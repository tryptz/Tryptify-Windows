"""Bake the world radio globe into its bundled asset.

    python3 tools/build_world_radio.py

Writes:
    app/src/main/assets/world_radio.json   coastline + cities that broadcast

Reads two committed inputs and never goes to the network:
    tools/world_coastline.geojson  Natural Earth 110m coastline (public domain)
    tools/world_land.geojson       Natural Earth 110m land polygons (public domain)
    tools/world_radio.json         the research cache from fetch_world_radio.py

Run tools/validate_world_radio.py afterwards.

Why the coordinates are integers
--------------------------------
The globe is drawn from 5,127 coastline points, and at 0.01° — about a kilometre
— the difference is far below one screen pixel at any zoom the map offers. Stored
as floats the coastline is 130 KB of "-61.08languageetc"; stored as hundredths of
a degree it is 55 KB of small integers, and the renderer divides by 100 once per
point. The precision thrown away here is precision nobody could ever see.
