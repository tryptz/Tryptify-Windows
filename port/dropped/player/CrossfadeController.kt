// Dropped on the desktop: done by the engine. Android ran the outgoing track's
// tail on a second ExoPlayer with a seeded copy of the DSP chain and ramped
// both players' volumes on a 40 ms tick; the desktop engine has one processor
// chain and one output, so it sums the two tracks itself, frame by frame along
// the same CrossfadeRamp curves, before that chain (PlaybackEngine's blend,
// player/engine/CrossfadeMix.kt). The stage logic carried over: EngineController
// arms the blend near the end like PlaybackService's watcher, the next track
// becomes current where the blend begins (this file's hand-off), and a skip
// cancels it. Kept for diffing against the Android file.

/**
 * Plays the tail of the outgoing track so the main player can move on early,
 * giving a real overlap between one track and the next.
 *
 * The main [ExoPlayer] carries everything — the session, the DSP console,
 * AutoEQ, the ProjectM tap, the USB sink — and is the only thing the rest of
 * the app knows about. Duplicating that chain for a second player is not
 * possible: the native DSP engine and its processors are single instances and
 * two players feeding them would corrupt both.
 *
 * So the split is asymmetric. At `duration - crossfade` the *current* track is
 * handed to this secondary player, seeked to where the main player had got to,
 * and faded out; the main player immediately starts the *next* track and fades
 * in. The main player therefore always holds what the UI calls "now playing",
 * and only the last few seconds of the outgoing track come from here.
 *
 * The tail is fully processed. It gets its own [DspChain] — a second native
 * DSP engine plus its own AutoEQ and Parametric EQ — seeded from the live
 * settings so it sounds identical to what was already playing, and destroyed
 * when the blend ends. Sharing the main chain is not an option: a processor
 * holds per-stream filter state and the native engine holds one sample rate,
 * so two streams through one chain would corrupt both.
 *
 * On the exclusive libusb path two sinks cannot share the DAC, so there the
 * tail does not play at all: it is processed into a mix point the main
 * stream adds into its own audio before packing it for the device
 * ([tf.monochrome.desktop.audio.usb.UsbCrossfadeMix]).
