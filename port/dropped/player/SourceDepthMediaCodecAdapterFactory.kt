/**
 * Asks an audio decoder for float output only when the source has more than
 * 16 bits to carry.
 *
 * Media3 asks every audio decoder for float whenever the sink takes float
 * directly, which LibusbAudioSink does on the normal output with hi-res output
 * on. That was meant to carry 24-bit FLAC past 16 bits, and it caught every
 * 16-bit FLAC as well, which gains nothing by it. Samsung's
 * c2.sec.flac.decoder (Galaxy A35, Android 16) answers that request for a
 * 16-bit file by reporting float output and writing 16-bit samples anyway.
 * Read as float, each pair of samples became one value that was either near
 * zero or far past full scale, and every buffer looked half as long as it
 * was. The result was full-scale static, and a play position running at twice
 * the real rate: DefaultAudioSink logged "Unexpected audio track timestamp
 * discontinuity" about every 200 ms.
 *
 * So a source that declares 16 bits or fewer is decoded to 16-bit. That is
 * what LibusbAudioSink was designed to receive from it ("16-bit: straight
 * through to the int branch"). A wider source still gets float, and so does
 * one that declares no depth at all: lossy codecs, and FLAC inside MP4. For
 * those, FloatPcmGuard checks that what comes out really is float.
