/**
 * Checks that PCM declared as float really is float, at the head of the hi-res
 * chain, and reads it as 16-bit when it is not.
 *
 * A decoder asked for float output can report float and write 16-bit samples
 * anyway. Samsung's c2.sec.flac.decoder does exactly that for a 16-bit FLAC
 * (see SourceDepthMediaCodecAdapterFactory, which no longer asks it to). Taken
 * at its word, every pair of 16-bit samples is read as one float. The bit
 * pattern of a negative sample makes a value far past full scale (or NaN or
 * infinity), and that of a positive one makes a value near zero. What reaches
 * the speaker is full-scale static, and every buffer counts as half its real
 * length, so the play position runs at twice the real rate.
 *
 * Real float PCM from a decoder stays within a few units of full scale and is
 * never NaN. 16-bit audio read as float fails both tests on roughly half its
 * samples, quiet passages included, because a small negative sample reads as
 * NaN. So the first buffer with real content gives the answer, before any of
 * it is played. From then on the stream is converted from 16-bit, which also
 * puts its frame count, and so the timing, right again.
 *
 * Once a second of audible audio has passed the check, the stream is trusted
 * and no longer scanned. Digital silence passes the check either way (zero is
 * zero in both readings), so it is never what decides. The verdict lasts until
 * the next configure, which is the next stream. A flush on its own is a seek,
 * still the same decoder.
