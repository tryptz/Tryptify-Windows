// Dropped on the desktop: replaced by app/src/main/kotlin/tf/monochrome/desktop/audio/sink/LibusbUacSink.kt.
// This was a Media3 ForwardingAudioSink: half of it fed Android's own output in
// three modes (direct, hi-res float, narrowed) and ran the processor chain for
// it, which the desktop engine does once, before any sink. The bypass half --
// the depth ladder, stream reuse, the negotiated subslot, back-pressure, the
// played-frames clock, the still-ours check and the wedge watchdog -- carried
// over into LibusbUacSink; the float packing did not, because
// floatToSubslotSample's 2^23 - 1 truncating scale moved every non-zero sample
// one LSB toward zero (audio/usb/UacPcm.kt packs exactly). Kept for diffing
// against the Android file.
