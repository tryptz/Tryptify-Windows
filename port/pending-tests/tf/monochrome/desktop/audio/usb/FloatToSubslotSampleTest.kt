/**
 * Float PCM → the integer a USB Audio Type I subslot carries.
 *
 * Worth pinning because every way to get this wrong still plays, so none of it
 * shows up as a crash or a silent stream: a bad scale is distortion at full
 * level, a missing left-shift is 48 dB of attenuation on a 4-byte DAC, and a
 * sign error is noise. The only way to see it is to look at the numbers.
