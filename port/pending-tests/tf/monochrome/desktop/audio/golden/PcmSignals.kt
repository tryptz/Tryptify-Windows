/**
 * Deterministic test signals, as float PCM in [-1, 1].
 *
 * Every audio test in this module grows its own sine loop, and they have
 * quietly drifted apart — different phase conventions, different amplitude
 * defaults, some in Double and some in Float. A golden fixture is only golden
 * if the signal that produced it is reproducible, so this is the one generator
 * they can share.
 *
 * ## Why StrictMath
 *
 * `Math.sin` is allowed 1 ulp of error and is free to differ between JVM
 * versions, platforms, and even between the interpreter and a JIT intrinsic on
 * the same machine. That is harmless for a tolerance test and fatal for a
 * bit-exact one: a fixture generated on one JDK would not compare equal on
 * another, and the failure would look like a DSP regression rather than a
 * changed transcendental. [StrictMath] is specified down to the bit — the same
 * fdlibm results everywhere, forever — so the fixtures these produce are
 * portable across every machine the suite will ever run on. That is the whole
 * reason the harness can assert bit-identity at all.
 *
 * Measurement code in [PcmCompare] uses plain `Math`: it reads signals rather
 * than defining them, and a 1 ulp difference in a magnitude is noise well below
 * any threshold worth asserting.
