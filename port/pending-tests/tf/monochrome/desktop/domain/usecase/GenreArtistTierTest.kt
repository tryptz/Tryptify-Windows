/**
 * The tier that fills a genre row from the genre's own artists.
 *
 * This exists because the row it replaces was a catalogue search for the
 * genre's *name*, which ranks records that say "neoclassical" above records
 * that are neoclassical. Every case below is a shape that search produced, or a
 * shape the fix would produce if one of these helpers were subtly wrong.
