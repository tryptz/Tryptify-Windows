/**
 * The one control that replaced two switches.
 *
 * The migration matters more than it looks: everyone already has the old switch
 * stored, and getting it wrong does not fail loudly -- it silently rearranges
 * how their visualizer behaves the next time they open it.
 *
 * These drive [PreferencesManager.rotationModeFrom] with a real [Preferences]
 * built from the *literal* key strings the old build wrote, rather than calling
 * the enum's mapping directly. That distinction is the whole point of the file.
 * The previous version tested the pure function with two booleans and passed
 * for months while the production read consulted `visualizer_preset_rotation`,
 * a key nothing has ever written -- so the mapping was perfect and the answer
 * was still Timer for every listener alive. A pure function over booleans
 * cannot see which key fed it; this can.
