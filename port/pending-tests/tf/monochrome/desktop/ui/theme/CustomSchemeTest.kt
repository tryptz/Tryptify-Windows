/**
 * The custom scheme, checked against WCAG AA on adversarial input.
 *
 * The presets are fifteen pairs someone designed. This one is built from
 * whatever two colours the listener pokes into a picker — including a black
 * accent on a black ground, or a yellow accent on white — so it cannot lean on
 * anything being sensible. What holds it together is the contrast floor: every
 * foreground is pushed toward the readable ink until it passes on the surface it
 * sits on. This sweeps a grid of pairs, plus the genuinely hostile cases, and
 * asserts the floor was actually reached.
