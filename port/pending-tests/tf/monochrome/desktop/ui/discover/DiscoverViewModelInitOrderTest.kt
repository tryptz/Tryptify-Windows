/**
 * DiscoverViewModel's init blocks must be the last things in the class.
 *
 * This is a source-level check because the failure it prevents is a source
 * ordering one, invisible to the compiler and to any test that builds the
 * ViewModel: Kotlin runs initializers in declaration order, so an init block
 * placed mid-class sees null for every property declared below it.
 *
 * The reason that reaches a discovery feed at all is that [rebuild] starts its
 * work with `viewModelScope.launch`, and a launch is not a promise to run
 * later. viewModelScope dispatches on Dispatchers.Main.immediate and a
 * ViewModel is constructed on the main thread, so the body runs *inline inside
 * the constructor* until its first real suspension point. Every field it reads
 * before suspending is read mid-construction.
 *
 * That took the tab down on cold launch once already. The read of
 * _selectedGenreId, a field declared 500 lines below the init, sat in a branch
 * the initial build never entered; moving it to the top of the coroutine body
 * was enough to dereference null on every launch. Nothing about that edit
 * looked dangerous, which is exactly why the rule is checked here rather than
 * written down and hoped for.
