 * Which artwork URIs are really audio files.

 * Pinned because both ways of getting it wrong are silent. Too loose and every
 * cover disappears from the notification with no error anywhere; too strict and
 * Media3 goes back to reading whole audio files into the Java heap to look for
 * a picture, which is what froze the audio thread on a 32-bit WAV.
