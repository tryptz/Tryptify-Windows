/**
 * What the debug log throws away before it reaches the buffer.
 *
 * The Errors tab is where you look when something is wrong, so what lands there
 * is the part of this filter that matters. On a ColorOS device it was entirely
 * vendor chatter logged at ERROR — a view-mirroring manager declining to handle
 * an ordinary window, an AudioTrack extension reporting no fade type — while
 * the app was working perfectly.
 *
 * The last test is the one to keep: native logging tags its lines with the
 * process name, so the codec line arrives under our own applicationId, and a
 * rule that dropped that tag wholesale would take real linker and ART failures
 * with it. It is matched on the message instead, and this proves the difference.
