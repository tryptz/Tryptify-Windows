/**
 * When the visualizer changes preset by itself.
 *
 * This was two switches that each claimed to do it. "Preset rotation" drove
 * projectM's own timer, "Auto-shuffle Presets" changed the preset on every new
 * track and drew the playlist in random order, and its description said it
 * rotated presets during playback -- which was the other one's job. Between
 * them there was no single answer to "stop changing my preset", because either
 * could still be doing it.
 *
 * One choice replaces both, and [Off] is one of its values rather than the
 * absence of two others.
