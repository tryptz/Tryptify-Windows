/**
 * Loads the bundled genre knowledge graph.
 *
 * Follows [RecommendationSeedsRepository]'s shape deliberately — asset JSON,
 * `ignoreUnknownKeys`, `runCatching`, fail soft — because the failure mode has
 * to be "discovery gets no smarter" and never "the app won't start". Every
 * caller treats an empty graph as "I don't recognise this", which is the same
 * behaviour the app had before the graph existed.
 *
 * Parsed once, lazily, on first use: ~130 KB across the two assets, immutable
 * afterwards, so there is nothing to invalidate and no reason to reload.

     * The `by lazy` above parses ~280 KB of JSON on whichever thread arrives
     * first, and `SearchViewModel` arrives with a query in hand — so the first
     * search in a session paid for it. [GenreHistoryRepository]'s note excuses
     * this ("only defensible because search needs it during startup anyway"),
     * and that was true of the intent and not of the code: nothing warmed it.
     * This is what makes the excuse true.
     *
     * Idempotent and cheap after the first call — `lazy` has already published
     * its value, so this is a field read. Not a replacement for the blocking
     * path: anything that asks before the warm-up finishes still gets a correct
     * graph, just on its own thread, exactly as before.
