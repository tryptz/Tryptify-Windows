/**
 * The globe's geography, and the stations currently playing on it.
 *
 * Two very different lifetimes behind one door. The *map* — coastlines and the
 * cities that broadcast — is a bundled asset that never changes between releases,
 * so it is parsed once and held. The *stations* are fetched per city and cached
 * only for the session, because the directory is a moving target and a listing
 * from an hour ago is already slightly wrong.
 *
 * Loaded the way [GenreHistoryRepository] loads its prose rather than the way
 * [GenreGraphRepository] loads the graph: suspending, on IO, once. Nothing needs
 * the globe during startup, so no frame should ever be spent parsing it.
 *
 * Fails soft throughout. A missing asset means an empty globe with a message, and
 * an unreachable directory means "couldn't reach the directory" — which the panel
 * states as a different thing from "this city has no radio", because it is.
