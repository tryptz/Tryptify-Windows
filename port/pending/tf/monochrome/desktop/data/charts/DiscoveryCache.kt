/**
 * What the discovery feed learned last time, kept on disk.
 *
 * The caches in front of the chart sources and the catalogue were memory only,
 * with a note saying charts are ephemeral and cheap to refetch and that the
 * cost is a cold start refetching. Both halves of that turned out to be wrong
 * about this feed. The prices are not small — a genre's artist set is a page
 * walk MusicBrainz paces at a request a second, and filling one genre row is a
 * catalogue lookup per charted record plus two per artist — and the TTLs
 * already written down say the answers are not ephemeral either: a day for a
 * tag chart, a week for an artist set, a month for an artist's tag cloud. A
 * cache that expires in a month and dies with the process has a TTL of one
 * session.
 *
 * So the answers outlive the process. The first Discover of the day pays what
 * it always paid; every one after it opens on work already done, which is the
 * difference between a page that assembles itself while you watch and a page
 * that is simply there.
 *
 * This is a cache in the sense the platform means it: it lives in `cacheDir`,
 * the system may delete it whenever it likes, and every read is prepared to
 * find nothing. A corrupt or unreadable file is treated as an absent one — it
 * is thrown away and refetched, never repaired.
