/**
 * The signed half of the Last.fm API: the request signature, the authorisation
 * URL, and the two shapes `auth.getSession` can answer with.
 *
 * Pure functions in their own file rather than methods on the service, for two
 * reasons. The signature is the part that silently breaks — a wrong one is not
 * an error you can see, it is a scrobble Last.fm quietly discards, which is
 * exactly how this app spent its whole history signing with the literal string
 * `"dummy_secret"` and looking like it worked. And it is now needed in two
 * places: scrobbling signs `track.scrobble`, and authorisation signs
 * `auth.getSession`. One implementation, tested against a fixed vector, is the
 * only version of that worth having.
