/**
 * The play head: which track, how far in, and how the queue is being walked.
 *
 * Split from [PlaybackQueueEntity] on purpose: this row is tiny and updated
 * every few seconds, the blob is large and changes only with the queue. SQLite
 * rewrites a whole record on any UPDATE, so one row would mean re-writing a
 * hundred-kilobyte blob every ten seconds for a six-byte number.
 *
 * [currentTrackId] sits beside the position so a restore can tell the two still
 * belong together — a queue edit between the writes would otherwise drop one
 * song's play head onto another.
