/**
 * Which animated spectrum belongs on the card for a given track.
 *
 * The badge is a scrolling spectrum curve with a real alpha channel, so it
 * floats on the card rather than sitting on a plate. It cannot be the
 * listener's actual audio — Discord renders this on somebody else's screen from
 * a payload sent once per track, and presence updates are rate limited orders
 * of magnitude below any frame rate worth the name. What it can match is the
 * two things that make a visualiser read as belonging to the music: the rhythm
 * it moves to, and what colour it is.
 *
 * Both come from data the app already has. The groove is chosen from the genre
 * graph; the colour from the cover palette the player extracts for its own
 * theming. Quantising them to eight grooves and eight hues is what keeps this a
 * fixed set of files served from the repository, rather than a video encoder
 * running on a phone once a minute and uploading the result somewhere.
 *
 * See `tools/build_presence_loops.py`, which draws them.
