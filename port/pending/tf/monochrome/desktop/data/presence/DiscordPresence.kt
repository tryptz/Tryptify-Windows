/**
 * The Discord gateway, as pure data: the frames sent, the frames understood,
 * and the activity a playing track becomes.
 *
 * Separated from the socket so all of it can be tested without one. A presence
 * bug is nearly invisible from inside the app — the card renders on somebody
 * else's screen, and a malformed activity is dropped by Discord in silence
 * rather than answered with an error — so the payloads are the part worth
 * pinning down exactly.
 *
 * **This is not the official Rich Presence path.** Discord's own SDK talks to
 * the *desktop* client over a local socket; Android has no equivalent and no
 * REST endpoint for setting your own presence. The only mechanism that works
 * from a phone is holding a gateway connection as the user and sending
 * [presenceFrame], which is what every Android presence app does. It is
 * automating a user account, which Discord's terms prohibit, and the token it
 * needs is unscoped. Both facts belong in front of anyone switching it on.
