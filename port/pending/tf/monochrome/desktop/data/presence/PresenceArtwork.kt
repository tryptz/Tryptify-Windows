/**
 * Spin the album art as a disc, as an animated WebP.
 *
 * The small-image slot is a fixed circle, so a badge can never span the cover's
 * width — the only surface with that width is the cover itself. Which means the
 * image has to be built here, on the device, because the artwork is different
 * every track.
 *
 * This used to draw a spectrum across the bottom third of the sleeve. It read as
 * a graphic *stuck on* the artwork rather than as anything the artwork was
 * doing, and on a busy cover the curve and the picture fought each other. A
 * turning disc is the same idea told properly: nothing is drawn over the art at
 * all, the art *is* the moving part, and everybody already knows what a record
 * going round means.
 *
 * Deliberately cheaper than the pre-drawn badges. Those are 60fps because a
 * build machine drew them once; this runs on a phone at every track change, and
 * a rotation at 60fps in 320px is a hundred and twenty full-canvas composites
 * and encodes for something rendered at a couple of hundred pixels on somebody
 * else's screen. [FRAMES] is the honest number for a device — and rotation is
 * the one motion where the step between frames is visible as judder, so it buys
 * a few more than the spectrum needed.
