/**
 * Whether a flag travels with the account or stays on the device that set it.
 *
 * The distinction is not "is this important" but "would the answer still be
 * right on a different device". A resampler the listener turned on is a taste,
 * and belongs beside the rest of their settings. A USB output backend is a fact
 * about one DAC on one phone; restoring it onto a device without that DAC would
 * enable a path that cannot engage there, and the failure would look like a bug
 * in playback rather than a restored setting.

/**
 * The seam switches for work in progress. Each one is declared here *before*
 * the change it gates exists, so the pull request that introduces a seam can be
 * read as one thing — the new path, and the branch that keeps the old one — with
 * no flag plumbing mixed into it.
 *
 * Two rules make that safe, and both are held by [FeatureFlagRegistryTest]:
 *
 *  - **Every flag defaults off.** The flag-off branch is the shipped behaviour,
 *    so a build with no stored preferences behaves exactly as it did before the
 *    flag existed.
 *  - **A flag's sync policy is declared, not inherited.** [FlagSync.ACCOUNT]
 *    flags are folded into [PreferencesManager.SETTINGS_SYNC_KEYS] from this
 *    registry rather than listed there by hand, so the allow-list cannot drift
 *    away from the registry — there is only one list.
 *
 * A flag with nothing reading it yet is expected: `owner` names the change that
 * will read it. When that change ships, the flag graduates by being deleted and
 * its branch made unconditional — a flag is scaffolding, not a permanent
 * setting.
