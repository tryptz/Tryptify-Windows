/**
 * Undoes Deezer's file encryption, as bytes stream past.
 *
 * `/api/deezer/download` hands back a signed link straight onto Deezer's CDN,
 * and the CDN serves every full-length file "striped": the file is cut into
 * 2048-byte blocks and every third one — blocks 0, 3, 6, … — is Blowfish-CBC
 * encrypted, with a fixed IV and a key derived from the track id. The rest is
 * plain. Written to disk as it arrives, the file starts with ciphertext where
 * "fLaC" should be, and nothing can play it.
 *
 * The output is the same length as the input, so Content-Length and download
 * progress still hold. A trailing block shorter than 2048 bytes is never
 * encrypted and passes through as is.
 *
 * Pure JVM (javax.crypto), so it is unit tested without a device.
