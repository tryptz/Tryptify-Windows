/**
 * Deezer playback cache — a copy of [QobuzStreamCacheManager] fed by
 * /api/deezer/download instead of /api/download-music.
 *
 * Downloads the audio file for a (trackId, quality) pair into its own cache
 * directory and keeps it there, so a second play is instant and works offline.
 * Bounded by total size with mtime-LRU eviction, separately from Qobuz's cap.
 *
 * The download is readable while it runs: [openPartial] returns as soon as the
 * response headers are in, and playback reads the growing file behind the
 * writer. The signed /api/file URL is fetched once and read once, top to
 * bottom, so its expiring signature is never re-presented.
 *
 * Deezer and Qobuz ids share one number range, which is why this is its own
 * cache rather than a second key prefix in Qobuz's: a track id alone could
 * never say which catalogue a cached file came from.
