/**
 * Qobuz playback cache.
 *
 * Downloads the audio file for a (trackId, quality) pair into the app cache
 * directory and keeps it there, so a second play is instant and works offline.
 * Bounded by total size with mtime-LRU eviction.
 *
 * The download is readable while it runs: [openPartial] returns as soon as the
 * response headers are in, and playback reads the growing file behind the
 * writer. Waiting for the complete file — which is what this used to do — put
 * seconds of silence in front of every Qobuz track.
 *
 * The signed URL is still fetched once and read once, top to bottom, so the
 * time-bounded `etsp` signature is never re-presented; that was the original
 * reason for pre-fetching, and streaming the single response preserves it. What
 * changes is only that the bytes are handed to the player as they land instead
 * of after the last one.
