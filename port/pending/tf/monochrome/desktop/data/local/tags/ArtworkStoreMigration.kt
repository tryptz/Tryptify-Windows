/**
 * Moves cover art out of `cacheDir` and into the durable store, once.
 *
 * A move and a key rewrite, not a rescan. Re-extracting would be the tidier end
 * state, but it is a full library scan — the exact thing this change exists to
 * stop at launch — behind a wall of placeholders. `renameTo` within a partition
 * is metadata only, so this costs one listing and three UPDATEs at any size.
 *
 * The trade: carried-over files keep their one-copy-per-track naming and
 * original size. They land in [ArtworkStore.legacyRoot] so
 * `MediaScanner.needsReRead` recognises them and the next *manual* rescan
 * replaces them a row at a time, with nothing forced on the user meanwhile.
