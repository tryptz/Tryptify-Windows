/**
 * Every folder the given track paths imply, as rows for `local_folders`.
 *
 * This used to key only on `path.substringBeforeLast('/')` — the folder holding
 * each *file* — so a folder that held nothing but other folders was never
 * written down. `getSubfolders()` looks up children by `parentPath`, so a
 * missing link did not hide one row, it severed the tree: everything below an
 * unlisted folder became unreachable in the browser.
 *
 * Two levels was enough to lose a library. For `/Music/Some/Deeper/a.mp3` the
 * only row was `/Music/Some/Deeper`, whose parent `/Music/Some` had no row of
 * its own, so opening `/Music` listed nothing at all and the screen was blank.
 * One level happened to work, which is why it read as "some folders".
 *
 * So ancestors are filled in up to the top of each path.
 *
 * `parentPath` keeps its old shape deliberately: the empty string above a
 * top-level folder, never null. `getRootFolders()` selects on `parentPath IS
 * NULL`, so handing `/storage` a null parent would make it a root and put a row
 * nobody asked for at the head of the Folders tab. Connecting the tree is the
 * fix here; what counts as a root is a separate question.
 *
 * `trackCount` is the whole subtree, not the files sitting directly in the
 * folder. For a folder that only holds other folders the direct count is zero,
 * and a row reading "0 tracks" above a hundred of them is worse than no row at
 * all. Leaves are unaffected: with no subfolders the two counts are the same
 * number, so nothing already on screen changes.

 * The folders the Folders tab opens on.
 *
 * The tab used to read `getRootFolders()`, which selects `parentPath IS NULL`
 * — and no row ever has that. `parentPath` is `substringBeforeLast('/')`, which
 * for a top-level `/storage` is the empty string, not null. That query has
 * always returned nothing, so the tab showed only the roots a user had added by
 * hand: a folder of 500 songs the scanner had indexed never appeared, while the
 * same songs filled the Songs list.
 *
 * The rule here is the one a person would apply looking at the tree: walk down
 * while there is nothing to choose. `/storage` holds only `emulated`, which
 * holds only `0` — three taps that ask no question — so the roots are `0`'s
 * children: Music, Download, and whatever else has music in it. Descent stops
 * at the first folder that branches or that holds tracks of its own, because
 * past that point the choice is the user's.
 *
 * Returns that level, not the folder above it: a row labelled "0" is not a
 * place anyone recognises.
