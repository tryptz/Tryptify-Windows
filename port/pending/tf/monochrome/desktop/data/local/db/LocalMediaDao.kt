     * The songs list, one page at a time.
     *
     * Eight queries rather than one @RawQuery with the ORDER BY pasted in.
     * Room checks these at build time; a RawQuery is a string, so a typo in a
     * column name is a crash when the tab opens instead of a failed build. The
     * list is the most-used screen in the app, which is exactly where that
     * trade should fall on the safe side.
     *
     * Every clause ends in `albumArtist, album, discNumber, trackNumber` — the
     * table's default order, and the order the Kotlin sort used to see. A
     * stable sort leaves rows the key ties on in the order they arrived, so
     * repeating the base order as a tiebreak reproduces that; and DESC repeats
     * it reversed, because the descending case reversed the whole sorted list,
     * ties and all. Reversing only the leading key would quietly reshuffle
     * every same-titled track. See LibrarySortTest.
     *
     * LOWER(COALESCE(title, filePath)) matches `displayTitle.lowercase()` for
     * every tagged file. Two known differences, both confined to sorting: an
     * untitled file sorts by its full path rather than by the bare filename
     * the row displays, and SQLite's LOWER only folds ASCII where Kotlin's
     * lowercase() is Unicode-aware.
