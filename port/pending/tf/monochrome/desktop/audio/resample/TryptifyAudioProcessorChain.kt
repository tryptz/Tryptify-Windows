/**
 * Replaces Media3's `DefaultAudioProcessorChain` so the two halves of a speed
 * change go to whichever engine can actually do them.
 *
 * The default chain hands everything to one Sonic instance, which splits the
 * work as `s = speed / pitch` and `r = rate * pitch`:
 *
 *  - **Preserve-pitch on** (`pitch == 1`): `s == speed`, so Sonic time-stretches
 *    with its WSOLA/AMDF path and `r == 1`, no resampling. Kept as-is here —
 *    time-stretching is a genuinely different problem from resampling.
 *  - **Pitch riding the tempo** (`pitch == speed`): `s` is exactly 1.0, which
 *    falls inside Sonic's `0.99999..1.00001` dead zone, so *no* stretch runs
 *    and the entire effect is `adjustRate` — two-point linear interpolation.
 *    That case is routed to [VariRateAudioProcessor] instead.
 *
 * Only one of the two is ever active: the other is left at unity, which makes
 * `isActive()` false for it and drops it out of the pipeline on the next flush.
