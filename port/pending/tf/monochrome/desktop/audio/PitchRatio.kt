/**
 * Equal-temperament ratios for the speed / pitch controls.
 *
 * The controls used to round to two decimals before storing — `Math.round(v *
 * 100) / 100f` — which is a coarse grid to land a musical interval on. A
 * semitone ratio is `2^(n/12)`: +2 semitones is 1.122462, and 1.12 is 3.8 cents
 * flat of it. Over one octave the worst case is -9 semitones, where 0.594604
 * rounds to 0.59 — **13.5 cents** flat, against a just-noticeable difference of
 * roughly 2-3 cents for beating between simultaneous tones. Float32 carries
 * about seven significant digits, so storing the ratio itself costs well under
 * a thousandth of a cent; the whole error was the rounding.
 *
 * Speed and pitch are the same number whenever pitch rides the tempo
 * (preserve-pitch off), which is why these live together: a "+2 semitones"
 * request there *is* a speed of 1.122462.
