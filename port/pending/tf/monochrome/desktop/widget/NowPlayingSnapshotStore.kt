/**
 * The last known now-playing state, written by the player and read by the widget.
 *
 * It exists so that drawing the widget does not have to *start the player*.
 * `readNowPlaying` used to build a `MediaController` against `PlaybackService`,
 * and connecting to a `MediaSessionService` starts it — so a widget refresh
 * constructed an ExoPlayer, a MediaSession and both FFmpeg renderers, read one
 * title off them, and let the whole thing be torn down again. A device log
 * caught it exactly: `ExoPlayerImpl: Init` at 23:36:35.848 and `Release` at
 * 23:36:36.244, four hundred milliseconds later, thirty-three seconds before
 * anybody opened the app — the process had been woken by WorkManager and the
 * widget refresh did the rest.
 *
 * The store is written from [PlaybackService]'s existing widget push, so it is
 * already current whenever there is a player to be current about, and it
 * survives the process: a widget drawn hours later shows the track that was
 * playing, paused, which is what it should show anyway.
 *
 * Its own DataStore file rather than `PreferencesManager`: the widget runs
 * outside Hilt — Glance hands a bare `Context` to `provideGlance` — and a few
 * fields the player owns do not belong in the file the settings screens edit.
 *
 * Transport taps still connect for real. Starting the service is the point of
 * pressing play; it is only *reading* that had no business doing it.
