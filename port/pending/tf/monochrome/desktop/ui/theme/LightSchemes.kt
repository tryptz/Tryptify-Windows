/**
 * Light themes, built rather than hand-written.
 *
 * The app had fifteen dark schemes and one light one, and the light one was the
 * only place a light value had ever been chosen deliberately. Everything else
 * light-adjacent was a dark token reused: `onSurfaceVariant` set to a grey
 * picked to sit on near-black, glass alphas tuned against a dark backdrop. On
 * white those choices do not degrade gracefully, they fail — secondary text
 * lands near 3:1, and a translucent white slab on a white page has no edge at
 * all.
 *
 * So a light scheme here is *derived*, from two inputs: the theme's accent, and
 * which paper it is printed on. Every foreground is then pushed through
 * [ensureContrast] against the surface it will actually sit on, so a scheme
 * cannot ship failing WCAG AA no matter what accent it was handed — which is
 * the part that hand-written palettes kept getting wrong, fifteen times over.
