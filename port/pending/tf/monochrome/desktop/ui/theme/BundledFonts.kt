 * All ten are variable fonts under the SIL Open Font Licence, taken unmodified
 * from github.com/google/fonts; the full licence text travels with them in
 * `assets/fonts/LICENSES.txt`. Variable means one file covers the whole weight
 * range, so the set costs about 2.3 MB rather than the ~10 MB the same coverage
 * would take as static cuts.
 *
 * The selection leans technical rather than decorative, because this is a
 * hi-fi player: most of these are grotesques and geometric sans that hold up at
 * list sizes and in the player's glass chrome. Fraunces and JetBrains Mono are
 * the two deliberate outliers — one serif, one monospace — for people who want
 * the interface to read as something other than another sans-serif app.
