 * dispatches to a builder that reads those role resources directly, which is
 * what makes this match the rest of the system exactly — featured colours and
 * the Contrast setting included — instead of re-deriving a palette from the

 * The [remember] is not an optimisation to taste. This sits at the theme root,
 * which recomposes continuously for the whole colour cross-fade window every
 * time the track changes (see `ColorBlend.millisFor` in MainActivity), and
 * building a scheme allocates every slot; without it this churned one full
 * ColorScheme per frame of every transition.
 *
 * Keyed on a colour read out of the palette rather than on the context, because
 * the context is not reliably a new one when the palette moves. Changing System
 * colors swaps a resource overlay, which normally recreates the activity — but
 * this activity declares `uiMode` in its own `configChanges` and so survives a
 * light/dark switch, and nothing obliges an OEM skin to deliver a contrast or
 * palette change any differently. Re-reading one colour per recomposition costs
 * a cached resource lookup and makes the cache self-invalidating whichever way
