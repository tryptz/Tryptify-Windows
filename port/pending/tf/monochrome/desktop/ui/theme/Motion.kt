/**
 * The spring every press in the app rides.
 *
 * Tight and barely bouncy — critically damped enough to look like the surface
 * moved under the finger rather than wobbled. It came from the player's dock,
 * which is the press that felt right, and it is shared so that "smooth like the
 * player" is one constant rather than a feel each screen re-invents.
 *
 * The old `bounceClick` default was DampingRatioMediumBouncy (0.5) at
 * StiffnessMedium (400): a long, visibly oscillating settle. On a glyph you
 * barely see it; on a full-width tile it is the wobble that reads as jank.
 *
 * One spring for both directions on purpose. The dock used to pair a bouncy
 * spring up with a tween down and it stuttered — a tween carries no velocity,
 * so releasing mid-bounce snapped the motion still before easing off.
 *
 * It drives the glass dome as well as the scale. Four presses raised that swell
 * with `spring(0.5f, StiffnessMediumLow)` in and `tween(260)` out — the mini
 * player's controls, the mini player bar, the play disc and the skip chevrons —
 * which is the same pairing, left behind in four files when the dock was fixed.
 * They read as instant next to the dock's slab, and a softer release of their
 * own did not close the gap: the dock's feel is this spring, not a slower one,
 * so they use this one now and match it exactly.

/**
 * "Disable animations" (Settings › System › Performance) in the form the UI
 * needs it.
 *
 * There are ~190 animation call sites in the app and switching every one of
 * them on a boolean would be both unreadable and beside the point — a spring on
 * a button press costs nothing next to a shader clock that runs at display
 * refresh for the life of the process. What is covered instead is the two kinds
 * that matter: motion that never stops on its own (infinite transitions, the
 * glass frame clock, colour blends) and motion met on every single interaction
 * (press feedback, tab changes). The latter is handled at its source — see
 * `Modifier.bounceClick` — rather than through a helper here.
 *
 * Compose's own animation APIs already honour the *system* "Remove animations"
 * accessibility setting from 1.2.0. This is the in-app switch beside it, for
 * people who want the OS animating normally and this one app still.
