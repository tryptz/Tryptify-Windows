/**
 * Scrolling a settings tab to the row a search result named.
 *
 * Landing on the right tab is most of the answer and, on the longer ones, not
 * the whole of it — Audio runs well past a screenful, so "you are on the tab
 * that contains it" still leaves someone scanning. This carries the wanted row
 * from the search bar to whichever tab draws it.
 *
 * Position-based rather than index-based, because a settings tab is not a list
 * of items: it is one lazy item containing the entire form. That is also what
 * makes this work at all — everything on the current tab is laid out, so the
 * wanted row reports its position without having to be scrolled into view
 * first.
