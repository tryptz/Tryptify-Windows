 * The "What's New" entries shown in About, and the version they belong to.

 * play. Two or three lines each, no jargon that isn't already on a settings
 * screen.
 *
 * When cutting a release, add a new [WhatsNewRelease] at the top with the new

 * Fixes live under [CHANGED]. Splitting them out reads as an apology list, and
 * from the outside "this works now" and "this works differently now" are the
