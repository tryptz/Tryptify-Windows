 * stretched to the width of the screen, the transport thrown to opposite ends,
 * the whole composition leaning left -- and every one of those was a modifier
 * whose effect could only be seen on a device. Pulled out here they are
 * numbers, and [PlayerLandscapeMetricsTest] can hold them at the sizes real
