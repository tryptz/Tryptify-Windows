/**
 * The waterfall as one triangle mesh, for a single `Canvas.drawVertices`.
 *
 * Why not the obvious drawLines/drawPath per line: a stroke wider than a
 * hairline with round caps is not something the GPU renderer batches.
 * `drawLines` turns every segment into a stroked path of its own — 127 per
 * line, 49 lines, some six thousand paths a frame — and Ridgeline's ground
 * added 49 concave anti-aliased fills on paths that change every frame, so no
 * work could be reused. That, not the history or the arithmetic, is what held
 * the player at half its frame rate.
 *
 * A mesh is the one thing the renderer draws as-is: it uploads the triangles
 * and draws them in order, in one call. Each line becomes a ribbon a few
 * vertices across — a solid core, and on each side a one-pixel fringe whose
 * vertex colours fall to transparent — which is the anti-aliasing the paths
 * used to compute, done once here instead. Ridgeline's ground is a strip from
 * each point down to the line's baseline, laid just before its line so the
 * draw order is the same back-to-front painter's order as before.
 *
 * Colours are per vertex: the screen-space gradient the shader used to give
 * (bright at the top of the box, the base colour at the bottom) is evaluated
 * at each vertex's height, with the line's own fade folded into the alpha.
 *
 * Indices are 16-bit, so one mesh holds at most [MAX_VERTICES] vertices; the
 * caller draws and calls [reset] when [hasRoom] says a line no longer fits.
 * Nothing is allocated after construction.
