/**
 * The album art stretched across the whole screen and blurred, dissolving from
 * one cover to the next over [blendMillis].
 *
 * Coil's own `crossfade` can't do this job: it skips the transition entirely
 * for a memory-cache hit, and a cover that was just on screen in the queue or
 * the hero is always a memory-cache hit — so the backdrop hard-cut on exactly
 * the track changes this is meant to smooth. It is also fixed at 100ms, which
 * would leave the artwork finished while a multi-second blend is still running.
 *
 * Both covers are drawn into one layer and blurred once, rather than blurred
 * separately and then mixed. A full-screen 64dp blur is the expensive part of
 * this backdrop, and running a second one for the length of a 12s blend is not
 * a price worth paying for something deliberately out of focus.
