/**
 * The floating panel that maps put over their canvas.
 *
 * Extracted so the genre map and the world radio globe are the same sheet of
 * glass rather than two that drift apart. There is more subtlety in here than
 * its size suggests, and every bit of it was learned the hard way:
 *
 * * **Three tiers, and the last one is real.** Shader glass on API 33+ when the
 *   listener has it on, the app's plain glassmorphism where haze is allowed, and
 *   an opaque surface otherwise. That last branch cannot be a no-op modifier —
 *   it is the only thing standing between the panel and having no background at
 *   all on a low-tier device.
 * * **Frost first.** The slab goes down to 0.2 opacity, and without a haze layer
 *   beneath it the canvas reads straight through and fights the panel's text.
 * * **A round shader canvas, not a rect.** The glass shader builds its bevel and
 *   rim from the gradient of what the canvas draws. A full-bleed rect gives it
 *   straight edges only, the parent clip then cuts the corners away, and each
 *   corner is left with no rim — four visible gaps in the outline.
 * * **Nothing gets through.** The canvas underneath is one big tap target that
 *   selects whatever is nearest, so without swallowing what the panel's own
 *   children didn't want, a tap on the panel's background reaches down and
 *   selects something else, throwing away the panel you were reading. The
 *   backstop is the panel's *bottom sibling*, not a modifier on the panel
 *   itself: as an ancestor it swallowed drags before the content's scroll could
 *   claim them, and gestures that take several events to declare themselves —
 *   which is every scroll — were lost two times in three.
 *
 * The [glass] parameter is the whole material: the frost above reads it, and it
 * is published as [LocalPlayerGlass] for the shader below, which takes its
 * bevel, refraction and rim from that local. Callers used to have to provide
 * the local themselves and a detail route that forgot got a panel frosted from
 * one set of settings and relit from another.
