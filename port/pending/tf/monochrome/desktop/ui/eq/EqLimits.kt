 * Shared range constants for the two EQ surfaces.

 * Both surfaces now share the same ±24 dB per-band range: the AutoEQ
 * *generator* stays conservative on its own (per-band safeBoost of 12/6/3 dB
 * by frequency), but user edits and imported profiles are no longer clamped
 * tighter than the Parametric surface — real-world APO exports carry >12 dB
 * bands. Callers are responsible for communicating headroom risk to the user.
