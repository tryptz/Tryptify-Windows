/**
 * Long-running subprocess reader that pipes `logcat -v threadtime --pid=<us>`
 * into [DebugLogBuffer]. Captures everything the Android logger sees for our
 * process — framework warnings, our own Log.* calls, native crash traces,
 * StrictMode violations — with no changes to existing logging code.
 *
 * API 24+ only allows an app to read its own pid's output (security hardening
 * from Nougat onwards), which is exactly what we want: `--pid=<us>` both scopes
 * the stream to our process and keeps the approach portable without adding the
 * `READ_LOGS` permission.
