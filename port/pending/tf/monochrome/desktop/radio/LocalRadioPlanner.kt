 * the weights at all — which meant that without a reachable server every knob
 * in Settings › Radio did nothing and radio fell back to "the seed artist's
 * top tracks, in catalogue order". Scoring here fixed that, and the service
 * has since gone; ranking never depended on it.
 *
 * Each signal below is normalized to roughly `0..1` (or `-1..1` where it cuts
 * both ways) and multiplied by its weight, so a weight of `0` silences its
 * signal, `1` is neutral, and `3` lets one signal dominate — which is exactly
 * what the slider's 0–3 range promises.
 *
 * [LOCAL_SIGNALS] names what this class acts on, and the settings screen reads
 * it so the UI cannot quietly drift from the truth. Every weight the model
 * carries is in there: the three that only ever described off-device datasets
 * went out with the service rather than stay as sliders that move nothing.
