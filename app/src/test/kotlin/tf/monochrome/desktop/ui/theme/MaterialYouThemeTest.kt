/**
 * The system palette entry, held to the three things that are easy to get wrong
 * about it and impossible to see from the code.
 *
 * The scheme itself is not asserted here and cannot be: it is read back from the
 * platform, needs a real Context, and its whole point is that it differs per
 * device and per wallpaper. What is pinned instead is the wiring around it —
 * that the entry is offered exactly where it works, named everywhere, and never
 * treated as one of the generated palettes. Each of those three has a failure
 * mode that is silent rather than loud.
