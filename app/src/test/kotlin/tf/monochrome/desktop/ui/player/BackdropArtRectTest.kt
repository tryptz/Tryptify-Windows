/**
 * The mapping that decides which pixels a pane of glass refracts.
 *
 * [backdropArtRect] inverts the `ContentScale.Crop` that BlurredCoverLayer
 * stretches the cover with, so the shader can ask "what is on the screen behind
 * me" in the artwork's own coordinates. Get it wrong and nothing crashes and
 * nothing looks obviously broken — the glass simply lenses the wrong part of
 * the cover, which reads as a texture rather than as a mistake. That is exactly
 * the kind of bug that survives review, so it is pinned here instead.
