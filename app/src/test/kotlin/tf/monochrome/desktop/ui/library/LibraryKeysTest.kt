/**
 * Library's Favorites and Overview pages each stack several `items()` blocks
 * into one `LazyColumn`, and Compose throws `IllegalArgumentException` the
 * moment two rows in one lazy list claim the same key — it does not fall back
 * to position.
 *
 * Both collisions this guards against are ordinary states, not corruption: a
 * liked track and a liked album carrying the same number (separate catalogue
 * namespaces, both `Long`), and a song that is both liked and recently played.
 * So the test is the number-sharing case, not a spread of unrelated ids.
