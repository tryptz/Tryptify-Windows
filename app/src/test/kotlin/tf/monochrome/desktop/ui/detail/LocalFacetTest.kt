/**
 * The facet that travels in `local_facet/{facet}/{value}`.
 *
 * `createRoute` itself is not tested here: it calls `android.net.Uri.encode`,
 * which is an unmocked android.jar stub in a JVM unit test and there is no
 * Robolectric on this source set. What is tested is the part that decides
 * whether the route can be parsed at all. (Desktop: Uri is a real shim here,
 * but createRoute lives in ui/navigation, which these tests do not cover.)
