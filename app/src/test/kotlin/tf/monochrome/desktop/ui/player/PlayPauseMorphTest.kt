/**
 * The geometry behind the play/pause morph.
 *
 * The first cut of this shipped visibly wrong, and none of it was wrong in a
 * way the compiler or a screenshot-free review could see: the two halves were
 * rounded independently, so the seam down the middle of the triangle was given
 * a corner radius, and the shape pinched into an hourglass with the point
 * hanging off it as if it were a separate glyph. What follows is the set of
 * properties that had to hold for it to be one shape.
