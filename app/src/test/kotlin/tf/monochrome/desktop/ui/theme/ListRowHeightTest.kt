/**
 * Every list row in the app is laid out at one shared height
 * ([MonoDimens.listRowHeight]) so a scrolling list reads as an even column
 * rather than a ragged one. A fixed height clips whatever does not fit, so the
 * height has to be big enough for the tallest shape a row can take — at every
 * text size, not just the default.
 *
 * That is what these tests hold. They walk the app's own text-size presets
 * (Settings › Theme, 0.85x..1.5x) crossed with the system font scale, and check
 * each row shape the app actually renders against the shared budget. A line
 * height raised in `Type.kt`, a bigger cover, or a trimmed row height that
 * would start clipping subtitles fails here rather than on someone's phone.
 *
 * The heights come from `Type.kt`'s own numbers rather than from
 * `buildTypography`, which needs font resources; if the two drift apart
 * [`the type scale still matches the numbers this test uses`] catches it.
