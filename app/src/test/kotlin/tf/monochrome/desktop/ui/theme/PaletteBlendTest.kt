/**
 * The album cross-fade, held to the property that makes it cheap.
 *
 * The fade used to hand out a new palette on every displayed frame, and every
 * distinct palette costs a rebuilt colour scheme and a recomposition of
 * everything reading it. Quantising the fraction means frames that would land
 * on the same colours compare equal instead, and `derivedStateOf` drops them
 * before any of that happens — so what is asserted here is not a number of
 * milliseconds but the count of values that escape, which is the thing the cost
 * is actually proportional to.
