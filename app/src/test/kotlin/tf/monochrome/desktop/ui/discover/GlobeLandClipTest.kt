/**
 * The globe's land fill, checked against the world it is drawing.
 *
 * This exists because of a bug that could not be caught by looking at one frame.
 * Far-side vertices used to be pushed radially onto the rim and emitted in the
 * ring's own order; a ring with a large hidden portion then dragged a rim trace
 * most of the way round the disc, and Afro-Eurasia seen from the far south
 * dragged it the whole way. One extra loop around the disc is one extra crossing
 * for every point inside it, so under an even-odd fill the globe inverted — sea
 * filled, continents punched out of it — and turning the Earth flicked in and
 * out of that state several times a second.
 *
 * A single camera proves nothing here, because most cameras were fine. So this
 * sweeps the camera over the whole sphere and asserts the only thing that must
 * never stop being true: deep ocean is not land, and the middle of a continent
 * is.
