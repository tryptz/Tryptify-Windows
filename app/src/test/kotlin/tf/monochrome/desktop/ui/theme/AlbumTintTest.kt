/**
 * "Tint the menus", held to the one promise that makes it usable.
 *
 * The feature hands the album's colours to [customScheme], which already has its
 * own contrast guarantees (`CustomSchemeTest`). What it cannot guarantee is
 * *stability*: it will happily build a light scheme from a bright cover and a
 * dark one from the next track, and a queue that alternates between the two
 * strobes the whole app between light and dark. That is the same class of bug as
 * the globe inverting, and it is exactly what [albumTintedGround] exists to
 * prevent — it moves the ground only a quarter of the way, so the theme keeps
 * deciding the polarity.
 *
 * These tests are that guarantee. Do not raise the mix to make a tint stronger.
