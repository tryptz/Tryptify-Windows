/**
 * The folder tree the browser walks.
 *
 * These exist because the tree used to have holes. `rebuildFolders` keyed only
 * on the folder holding each *file*, so a folder containing nothing but other
 * folders was never written down — and `getSubfolders` finds children by
 * `parentPath`, so one missing link cut off the entire subtree beneath it. A
 * user's `/storage/emulated/0/Monochrome+` opened to a blank screen for exactly
 * this reason: its music was two levels down.
 *
 * The first three tests are that bug, at one, two and three levels of nesting.
