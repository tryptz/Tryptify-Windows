/**
 * The two things that made the discovery feed's caches not behave like caches:
 * six shelves asking the same question at the same moment, and a batch of
 * lookups moving at the pace of its slowest member.
 *
 * These run on [runBlocking]'s single-threaded event loop on purpose. The
 * properties here are about who is allowed to be waiting on what, and a test
 * that relied on real parallelism to demonstrate them would be a test that
 * passes for timing reasons.
