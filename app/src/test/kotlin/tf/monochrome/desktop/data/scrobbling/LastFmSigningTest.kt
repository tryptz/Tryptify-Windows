/**
 * The signed half of the Last.fm API.
 *
 * Everything here is guarding the same failure mode: a signature Last.fm does
 * not accept is not an error anyone sees. The server answers politely, the
 * scrobble is dropped, and the app looks connected. That is exactly how this
 * codebase shipped a client signing with the literal string `"dummy_secret"`
 * for its entire history — so the signature is pinned against vectors computed
 * independently, not against the implementation's own output.
