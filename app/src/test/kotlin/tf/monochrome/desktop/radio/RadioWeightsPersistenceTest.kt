/**
 * The weights are written out field by field in three parallel blocks —
 * `clamped()`, and PreferencesManager's read and write — and a copy-paste slip
 * in any one of them loses a slider silently: it moves, it saves nothing, and
 * nothing fails. A wire test used to collect that price, because every field
 * also had to reach the planner service under its own name. The service is
 * gone; this replaces the guard it was incidentally providing.
