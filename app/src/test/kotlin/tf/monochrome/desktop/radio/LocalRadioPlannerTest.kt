/**
 * The weights have to change what radio actually plays, with no server in the
 * loop. Every test here isolates one weight: the baseline silences all of them
 * (every weight `0`), then the one under test is raised, so a preference that
 * appears can only have come from that signal.
 *
 * The pairs are built to differ in exactly the thing the weight names, so
 * "raising it changes the order" and "zeroing it removes the preference" are
 * both asserted — a signal that is always on is as broken as one that never is.
