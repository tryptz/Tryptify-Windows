/**
 * The researched genre histories, checked against the **real bundled asset**.
 *
 * What needs guarding here is not that the model compiles — it is that the
 * thing shipped in the APK is what it claims to be. Every entry is prose about
 * a genre, taken from a named revision of a named article, filed under a genre
 * the map actually has. Those are the properties that make the panel a citation
 * rather than an assertion, and they are exactly the ones that a re-run of
 * `tools/fetch_genre_history.py` against a changed Wikipedia could quietly
 * break.
 *
 * The naming check is the load-bearing one. An entry keyed to `samba-de-roda`
 * whose text is the Samba article is *true prose about the wrong genre* — the
 * single failure this dataset is most likely to develop, and the one that no
 * amount of eyeballing a 700-entry JSON file would catch.
