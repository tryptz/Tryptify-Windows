/**
 * Lazy-list keys for discovery cards.
 *
 * A shelf can hold tracks, albums and artists, and their ids come from three
 * different namespaces that freely overlap — album 1234 and artist 1234 are
 * both ordinary. Keying a `LazyRow` on the bare id would let two different
 * cards claim the same key, which Compose treats as a duplicate and crashes on.
 * The type prefix is what stops that, so it is tested rather than assumed.
