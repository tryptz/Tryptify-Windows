 * The globe, checked against the **real bundled asset**.

 * the app will draw is a place that exists and that you can actually tune into.
 * A city with no stations, or one at coordinates off the sphere, is not a
 * cosmetic defect: it is the map making a claim it cannot keep, and neither
 * would ever be caught by eye in a 1,600-entry JSON file.
