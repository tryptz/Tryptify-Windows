/**
 * The vocabulary the roadmap's audio gates are written in.
 *
 * P0.4 asks for "max sample deviation <= 1 LSB @ 24-bit" and "no clipping on
 * 0 dBFS input with dither on"; P0.0 asks that a flag-off build be "byte
 * identical on golden fixtures". Those are three different questions and they
 * were being answered ad hoc, per test, with whatever the author reached for.
 * Naming them once means a gate can be quoted rather than re-derived, and that
 * two tests claiming "bit-identical" mean the same thing by it.
