/**
 * The audio the visualizer is allowed to see, and when.
 *
 * The tap sits upstream of the output device, so the picture always runs a
 * little ahead of the sound; over Bluetooth that gap is wide enough to watch.
 * What is asserted here is the withholding itself -- that a frame is not handed
 * over until it has aged past the delay -- because that is the whole mechanism,
 * and the thing that would silently revert to the old behaviour.
