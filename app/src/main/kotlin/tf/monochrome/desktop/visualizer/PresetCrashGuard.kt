/**
 * Notices a preset that crashed this device, so it is never loaded again.
 *
 * The host scan ([KnownCrashPresets]) catches what crashes projectM itself. It
 * cannot catch a preset whose shaders kill one vendor's GPU driver, and that
 * crash takes the whole process with it — there is no exception to catch and
 * no later moment in which to react. So the bridge writes the preset it is
 * about to load to [sentinel] before every load, and deletes the file when it
 * is released cleanly. If the next process finds the file, the last one died
 * with that preset on screen.
 *
 * Died is not the same as crashed. On Android 11 and later the exit record for
 * the dead process says why, and only a native crash or an ANR (a preset that
 * hangs the render thread) flags anything; a swipe from recents, a low-memory
 * kill or an app update does not. Older versions keep no record, so there the
 * file alone decides. That is less certain, but a clean exit there still
 * releases the surface, and with it the file, before the process goes.
