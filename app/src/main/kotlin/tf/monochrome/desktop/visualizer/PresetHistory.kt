/**
 * Where Previous goes.
 *
 * A stack of presets we have moved away from, rather than an index into the
 * preset list: Next is the native playlist's business and it shuffles, so
 * "the one before this" is not the entry above it in the list — it is
 * whatever you were actually watching.
 *
 * Pulled out of [ProjectMEngineRepository] so the walk-back rules can be
 * tested without a GL context, for the same reason [shouldDropFrame] is a
 * free function: the failure here is quiet. A stack that records its own
 * walk-back makes Previous bounce between two presets forever, and one that
 * never evicts holds every preset of a long shuffling session alive.
 *
 * Thread-safe: recorded from the main thread (a Select) and from the GL
 * thread (a Next landing), so every operation takes the lock.
