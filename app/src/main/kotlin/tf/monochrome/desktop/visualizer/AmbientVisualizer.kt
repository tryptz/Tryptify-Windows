/**
 * MilkDrop as a layer inside the album's atmosphere, rather than instead of it.
 *
 * The hero visualizer replaces the artwork: an opaque black surface at the
 * cover's aspect ratio, or the whole screen. This is the other composition —
 * the preset drawn *over* the blurred cover and its scrim, under the player's
 * glass, so the visuals feel like part of the artwork rather than a separate
 * full-screen mode.
 *
 * ## Transparency is inferred from the rendered image, not from the preset
 *
 * MilkDrop presets assume they own an opaque framebuffer, usually black, and a
 * great many depend on frame feedback — trails, warps, glow accumulation. Make
 * the render target transparent and those break. So projectM keeps rendering
 * exactly as it always has, into an opaque buffer, and the alpha is derived
 * afterwards from the pixels it produced: black falls away, dim trails go
 * translucent, bright waves and particles survive. That is what makes this
 * work across an entire `.milk` collection without touching a single preset.
 *
 * ## Why the maths lives here in Kotlin as well as in GLSL
 *
 * [AMBIENT_FRAGMENT_SHADER] is the code that runs. The functions in this file
 * are the same arithmetic written again in Kotlin, and they exist so it can be
 * tested: there is no device in the build, so a shader is otherwise a string
 * nobody can check. The two must be kept in step by hand — `AmbientVisualizerTest`
 * pins the behaviour the shader is supposed to have.
