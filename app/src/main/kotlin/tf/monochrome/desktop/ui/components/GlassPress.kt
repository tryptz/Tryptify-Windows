/**
 * How hard a sheet of glass is being pressed, and where.
 *
 * Glass in this app already knows how to deform: the AGSL shader takes a bulge
 * centre and an amount, and the player's transport and the mini player's two
 * controls have always swelled under a finger. Nothing else did — every other
 * pane was a slab that either did nothing on press or scaled as a flat
 * rectangle, so the same material behaved like two different substances
 * depending on which screen you were on.
 *
 * This carries the press so both halves of the effect can read it: the shader
 * swells toward the finger, and the pane gives under it. Kept as one object
 * rather than two loose values because the centre is meaningless without the
 * amount — a bulge at full strength in the middle of a pane nobody touched is
 * worse than no bulge at all.
