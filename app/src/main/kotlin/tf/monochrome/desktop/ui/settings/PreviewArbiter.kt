/**
 * Which of a screen's live previews may run: the one most on screen, and only
 * that one.
 *
 * The Studio's Visualizer tab is one scrolling column, and a column composes
 * every child whether it is in view or not — so the spectrum waterfall's
 * preview and Wave Candy's both ran their frame loops all the time, each
 * drawing every refresh, including while scrolled out of sight. Each preview
 * reports how much of it is visible; the larger share wins, and the other
 * stops drawing until it is the one being looked at.
