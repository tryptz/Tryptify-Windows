/**
 * The hero album art, dissolving from one cover into the next.
 *
 * The new cover arrives slightly oversized and settles to its final size as it
 * becomes opaque, over an outgoing cover that stays put and fully opaque. That
 * asymmetry is what makes it read as one image becoming another rather than two
 * images ghosting: nothing ever thins out, so the player background never shows
 * through the middle of a transition the way it would if both sides faded.
 *
 * **How long it takes depends on why the track changed.** Left alone, the art
 * moves with the audio — [blendMillis], the "Blend Between Tracks" length, so a
 * long crossfade doesn't finish repainting while the previous song is still
 * playing. Asked to change, it takes [MANUAL_MORPH_MS]: a manual skip cancels
 * any blend in progress and cuts the audio immediately, so a slow dissolve
 * would be describing a transition that isn't happening, and the swipe gesture
 * already carries its own 260ms slide.
 *
 * [userTrackChanges] is the counter `PlayerViewModel` bumps on every playback
 * change the UI asked for. Compared at the moment the track changes, so a
 * change with no counter movement is one the player made on its own.
