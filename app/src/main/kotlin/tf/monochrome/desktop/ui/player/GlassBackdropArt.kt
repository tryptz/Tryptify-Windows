/**
 * The real pixels behind the player's glass, so the shader can lens *the
 * artwork* instead of the procedural stand-in it reconstructs in
 * [LIQUID_GLASS_SRC]'s `backdropField`.
 *
 * ### Why a bitmap and not a live layer capture
 *
 * The obvious design — capture the backdrop into a `GraphicsLayer` every frame
 * and hand it to the shader — is not expressible on the platform.
 * `RenderEffect.createRuntimeShaderEffect(shader, "content")` binds exactly
 * ONE input, and this shader already spends it: `content` is the pane's own
 * pixels, whose alpha field is the heightfield every bevel normal is derived
 * from. A second `uniform shader` has to be set through
 * `RuntimeShader.setInputShader`, which takes an `android.graphics.Shader` —
 * and there is no public way to turn a `GraphicsLayer` (or the `RenderNode`
 * under it) into one. So a live capture cannot be a second input.
 *
 * The album art can, because it is already a bitmap and it only changes when
 * the track does. That covers the case that actually matters: with the blurred
 * album background on, the cover *is* what is behind every pane in the player.
 *
 * ### Why the thumbnail is tiny
 *
 * The backdrop this has to match is [BlurredCoverLayer] — the cover stretched
 * over the screen under a 64dp gaussian blur. Lensing a sharp, full-resolution
 * cover would refract detail that is nowhere on the screen, and it would read
 * as a bug rather than as glass. A [ART_SIZE]px thumbnail sampled with the
 * hardware's bilinear filter is, to within a few percent, that blur already —
 * for one ~64KB texture uploaded once per track instead of a per-frame capture.
 * The bilinear part is load-bearing and has to be asked for explicitly; see
 * the filter mode set in [rememberBackdropArt].
