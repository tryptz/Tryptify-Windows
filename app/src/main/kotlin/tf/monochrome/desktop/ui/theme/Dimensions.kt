     * visible in a long scrolling list.

     * Derived from the typography rather than pinned to a dp constant because
     * the app ships its own text-size setting (Settings > Theme, 0.85x..1.5x)
     * and rebuilds the whole type scale from it. A hard 64dp is right at 1.0x
     * and clips the subtitle at the top presets; this tracks the type, so the
     * rows grow together and stay equal at every scale.
     *
     * The budget is the tallest row shape the app has: a `bodyLarge` title over
     * a `bodySmall` subtitle carrying a link inset, or the 48dp cover if the
     * type is smaller than that, plus the row's own vertical padding.
