 *
 * Deliberately NOT `launchSingleTop`, which is a trap here. It does not compare
 * the route: `NavController.launchSingleTopInternal` matches on the destination
 * itself, then removes the top entry and puts a copy back carrying the new
 * arguments. `folder/{folderPath}` is one destination, so walking from a folder
 * into its subfolder *replaced* the folder you came from — Back had nothing
 * left to return to and dropped you out of the browser. The same held for every
 * trail through one screen type: album → album, artist → artist, genre → genre.
 *
 * The duplicate it was meant to stop is the double-tap, and [isSettled] above
 * already stops that: after a navigate the new entry is the current one and is
 * not RESUMED until its transition finishes, so the second tap is dropped.
 * Re-entering a screen from a *different* screen is what [navigateTool] is for.
