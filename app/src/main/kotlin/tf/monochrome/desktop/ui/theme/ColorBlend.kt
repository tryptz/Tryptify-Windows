 * It used to default to matching "Blend Between Tracks", on the reasoning that
 * a colour fade the length of the audio blend ends on the last sample of the
 * outgoing track — the picture and the sound moving together. The argument is
 * sound and the result was not: a blend of four or six seconds is an ordinary
 * setting, and it made the default colour transition a four- or six-second
 * animation repainting the whole window on every track change. The slider's
 * first stop read "Match blend · 4.00 s", which is a long way from what the
 * left end of a slider is expected to cost.
 *
 * So the two are unhitched. The fade is [DEFAULT_MS] unless it is set, the
 * stops start at zero, and anyone who wants the old pairing can read their
 * blend and dial the same number in.
