/**
 * God rays through the lyrics: volumetric light scattering as a screen-space
 * post-process (GPU Gems 3, ch. 13), the way Community Play 3D's "God rays,
 * what's that?" and the Shadertoy "Crepuscular light" (ls2Xzd) do it.
 *
 * The light is a direction in 3D — an azimuth around the screen and an
 * elevation out of it — projected onto the lyric surface ([GodRayGeometry]).
 * Every pixel then marches toward that point and gathers what it passes:
 *
 *  - **Letters** ([LyricsFxSettings.GOD_RAYS_LETTERS]): the sung line is the
 *    light. Samples inside its band are summed, so each letter streams a shaft
 *    away from the light — the Shadertoy's image-as-emitter, with the line as
 *    the image.
 *  - **Backlight** ([LyricsFxSettings.GOD_RAYS_BACKLIGHT]): the article's
 *    occlusion pass. A disc of light sits at the projected point, every lyric
 *    blocks it by its alpha, and the letters' shadows stream through the
 *    shafts.
 *
 * This modifier is the lyric view's own rays, for a screen with no
 * [LyricBackdropFx] under it (the legacy player). Apply it OUTSIDE the lyric
 * surface's side padding and outside the glass, so the shafts are computed
 * from the finished glass letters and can run to the screen edge (see
 * `SyncedLyricsView`). The render effect cannot draw past its own layer, so a
 * layer inset from the edge would cut every shaft off at the inset in a hard
 * vertical line.
 *
 * The light's `band` ([rememberLyricRayLight]) is what is being sung, in root
 * px: the line, running
 * the full width ([GodRayGeometry.UNBOUNDED] either side), or with
 * [LyricsFxSettings.godRaysFollowWord] the one word. It decides what shines in
 * Letters mode, where the light sits when it faces you head-on, and where the
 * shafts are dimmed so the words stay readable. Null makes the whole surface
 * shine, with no legibility guard.
 *
 * Requires API 33 (RuntimeShader). Below that, with the low-performance glass
 * switch on, or if the shader will not compile, this is a no-op.

 * moves the light — the clock, the tilt, the beat, the sung band, the lyric
 * surface's box — is snapshot state, so every layer reruns when it moves and
 * nothing recomposes.
 *
 * It is computed once, in root px, and each layer that draws it — the
 * backdrop's shafts, the light on the letters, the glass, the shadow — only
 * moves it into its own pixels ([frameFor]). Nothing in it depends on how big
 * the layer drawing it is. It used to be worked out as shares of the rays
 * layer's long side, which is the preview's width in the Studio and the
 * screen's height in the player, so the same settings put the light more than
 * twice as far from the sung line in the player and the two looked nothing
 * alike (seen on device). Every distance is a share of [scale], the window's
 * short side, instead: the same on every screen the lyrics are shown on, and
 * about the long side of the lyric surface the rays were tuned on.
