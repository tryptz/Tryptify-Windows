 * then began at its own new top edge and clipped there, so rows scrolling up
 * vanished at a boundary an inch short of the glass instead of passing under it.

 * toggled: the first row sits behind it for as long as it is open and scrolls
 * out from under it, which is a moment. The bar's measured height for one that
 * is [reserveSpace] — permanent — where "behind the bar" would mean *forever*.
