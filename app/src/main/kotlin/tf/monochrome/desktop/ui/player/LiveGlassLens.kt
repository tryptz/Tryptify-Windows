/**
 * Glass that bends the real screen behind it, the way iOS draws it.
 *
 * Every other pane in the app refracts a stand-in: [LIQUID_GLASS_SRC] spends its
 * one RenderEffect input on the alpha heightfield its bevel is built from, so the
 * backdrop it lenses has to be reconstructed or handed over as a thumbnail. The
 * lens rim does not need a heightfield — it is computed from the pane's corner —
 * and that frees the input for the backdrop itself.
 *
 * So this layer draws Haze's own capture of the screen behind it (the
 * [HazeState] areas' content layers, the same recording the haze blur samples),
 * offset to where this pane sits, blurs it, and then runs [LIVE_LENS_SRC] over
 * the blurred result: blur first, then bend. What comes out is the live backdrop, bent by the same
 * rounded rim as the slab, under the same frost tint the haze pane used.
 *
 * It replaces the haze pane under a punched slab; the slab still draws on top
 * and supplies the tint, the rim light and the control holes.
 *
 * Same rule as any haze pane: it must be a sibling of the haze source, never
 * inside it. Drawing the source's layer from inside itself would recurse.
 *
 * Prototype: wired into [GlassPanel], the full player's disc and dock, and
 * the mini player and tab bar, behind [LIVE_LENS_GLASS]. The mini player and
 * the tab bar are one material: same lens, same [LIVE_LENS_CHROME_BLUR_SHARE],
 * same tint (docs/ui-invariants.md).
