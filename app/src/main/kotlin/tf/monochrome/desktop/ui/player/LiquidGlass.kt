/**
 * "Liquid glass" treatment for the lyric surfaces: an AGSL RenderEffect that
 * turns the already-drawn glyphs into real, refractive glass. The bevel normal
 * is derived from the text's own alpha field (so it stays draw-only — layout,
 * font size and line spacing are untouched); the glyph body is rendered
 * see-through, the smooth album-tinted backdrop is reconstructed and *lensed*
 * through that bevel (with chromatic aberration), and a bright specular rim
 * rides the beveled edge. The light direction follows device tilt (gravity
 * sensor) plus a slow autonomous drift. Nothing travels across the surface:
 * the living motion undulates in place, so the glass never draws the eye.
 *
 * [tint] is the album colour the reconstructed backdrop and the glass frost are
 * tinted with — pass the active accent so the refraction matches what's behind
 * the lyrics.
 *
 * Requires API 33 (RuntimeShader); below that, or if the shader fails to
 * compile on some GPU driver, the modifier is a no-op and lyrics render as the
 * solid text they were handed.

    // used to glide across every pane every ~7s — the classic "shine" pass — and
    // it was the one motion here you could not look away from: it crosses the
    // whole pane, it is the brightest thing on it while it does, and unlike the
    // shimmer and the swell it has somewhere to be, so the eye tracks it off the
    // edge and then waits for the next one. Removed rather than damped: at any
    // brightness a band crossing the pane still reads as an event, and glass is
    // meant to be a surface, not a signal. The other liquid terms stay — they
    // undulate in place, so they read as material rather than as something
    // happening. Do not reintroduce a sweep here without asking.

    // Highlight shoulder: every edge term above stacks additively in the same
    // 1-2px band (Fresnel rim + glint, each gained by its own knob), and
    // the premultiply clamp below used to flatten any overflow into a solid
    // max-brightness line — the over-sharpened halo look when several edge
    // settings run hot. Roll intensities above the knee off asymptotically
    // toward white instead; pixels below the knee are bit-identical, so calm
    // presets keep their exact look and only blown rim pixels are compressed.

    // Transparent face, opaque bright rim: alpha is low across the body (backdrop
    // reads through) and climbs to full where Fresnel and the glint peak, so the
    // rim highlight reads as a crisp glass edge rather than being clamped away.
    // Same shoulder as the colour: the outline saturates to opaque gradually
    // instead of snapping, so the rim doesn't etch a hard 1px contour.
    // A lit edge carries alpha too, or the premultiply clamp below would cut
    // the rays' light off wherever the body is see-through.
