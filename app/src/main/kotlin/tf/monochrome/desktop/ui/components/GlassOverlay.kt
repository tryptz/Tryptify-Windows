/**
 * Where a floating pane goes when it has to be made of glass.
 *
 * A `Dialog` and a `ModalBottomSheet` each open their own window, and a haze
 * effect cannot sample a layer belonging to another one: the backdrop it wants
 * to blur was captured into the window underneath. Handed a haze state across
 * that boundary it paints its own base colour and comes out as a flat slab,
 * which is the failure `docs/ui-invariants.md` keeps warning about, and there is
 * no setting that fixes it. The pane has to be drawn in the window whose
 * background it is blurring.
 *
 * So this is that window's slot. The host is published by the nav host, which
 * renders whatever is registered as the topmost sibling *of* its haze source —
 * a sibling, not a descendant, because a pane inside the source would be trying
 * to blur a picture it is part of. The page indicator above the pager already
 * works exactly this way.
 *
 * What that costs is the scrim and Back, which `Dialog` gave away for free and
 * are handled here instead. That is the cheaper half of the trade.
