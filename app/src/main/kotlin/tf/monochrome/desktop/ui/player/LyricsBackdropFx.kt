/**
 * The lyrics' light and shadow on the BACKGROUND, under the glass UI.
 *
 * The god rays and the shadow used to be drawn inside the lyric surface, so a
 * shaft stopped dead at its bottom edge, just above the song title (seen on
 * device), and the player's glass — the title, the progress tube, the play
 * disc, the dock — never had any of the light under it. Here they are drawn
 * in the player's `fxUnderlay`: full screen, after the album background and
 * before everything else, and inside the haze sources, so the glass panes
 * frost and bend the shafts like the rest of the backdrop.
 *
 * The light comes from the sung letters, which live in another layer, and a
 * render effect can read nothing but its own. So the lyric view records its
 * letters into a [GraphicsLayer] ([captureLetters]) and this layer draws that
 * copy as its input. The copy is taken before the glass, so the glass shader
 * does not run twice, and it never shows: the effect hands back the shadow and
 * the shafts alone ([GOD_RAYS_SRC]'s `uRaysOnly`), and the real letters draw
 * over them later. Back to front: shadow, shafts, letters.
 *
 * "On top" is drawn here too, so its shafts run under the glass UI as well.
 * While they stayed in the lyric surface they stopped dead above the song
 * title (seen on device). The one thing a layer under the letters cannot do is
 * add the light over them, so the lyric view does that part alone, on its own
 * letters ([lyricRaysOnLetters]). Shafts under the letters plus their own light
 * added to them is the "On top" composite.

 * composite, and the letters are the only place it lands, so the march runs
 * on their pixels alone.
 *
 * It is a render effect on the letters' own layer, not a layer of light laid
 * over them, for two reasons. The composite caps the light at what a letter
 * covers, and only the real letters know that: capped on the backdrop's copy,
 * which is drawn before the glass at full strength, there was never any room
 * and the sung line stood grey under its own light (seen in a render through
 * Skia). And it leaves the letters' alpha as it is, so the edge fade's
 * offscreen buffer takes them like any others; a separate layer adds alpha
 * there that hides the shafts behind every soft letter.
 *
 * Put it where [lyricGodRays] would go: outside the glass, so the light is
 * gathered from and added to the finished letters. A no-op without a
 * backdrop (the lyric view's own rays add it then), out of "On top", or below
 * API 33.
