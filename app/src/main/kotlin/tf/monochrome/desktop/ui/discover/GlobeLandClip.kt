 * that is easy to get subtly, intermittently wrong and impossible to eyeball:
 * the failure it exists to prevent showed up as the whole globe inverting —
 * ocean filled, continents punched out of it — for a few frames at a time while
 * the Earth was being turned. Everything here is pure maths over plain arrays so
 * a unit test can sweep the camera over the real asset and check that the sea
 * stays sea.

     * point inside it, so under an even-odd fill the entire globe inverted.
     *
     * Instead the ring is cut into the runs that are actually visible, each
     * bracketed by its exact limb crossings, and the runs are rejoined by
     * walking the rim from one run's exit to the next run's entry. Which way
     * round the rim is the whole question, and it is answered by the ring's own
     * winding rather than guessed from the projection: the interior lies to the
     * opposite hand from the way the boundary is traced, so the walk goes
     * against the winding. Walking it the other way fills the sea instead of the
     * land — which is the bug, reintroduced.
