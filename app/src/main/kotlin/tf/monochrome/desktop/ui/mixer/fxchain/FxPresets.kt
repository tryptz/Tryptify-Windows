 * EchoBoy manual; iZotope and Abletunes EQ guides; AutoEQ; streaming loudness
 * targets (−14 LUFS, −1 dBTP); and mastering practice for bus compression
 * (1.5–2:1, 1–2 dB of reduction), broad ±1–2 dB tilts, short low-cut
 * ambience at 8–12 %, and mono-safe width. Where an effect of ours behaves
 * differently from its namesake the values were designed around ours (e.g.
