/**
 * The genre map — all 771 genres as one picture you can move around in.
 *
 * Twelve radial clusters, one per family, arranged so that the families sharing
 * the most genres end up next to each other — electronic beside hip-hop and pop,
 * metal beside rock, folk beside country. Inside each cluster a genre fans out
 * from its family root, and the fusion genres lean out of their cluster toward
 * whatever else they belong to, so jazz house comes to rest between electronic
 * and jazz rather than pretending to sit wholly inside one of them. Where a
 * genre lies is an argument about what it is.
 *
 * Coordinates are baked into the asset at build time
 * (`tools/build_genre_graph.py`), not simulated here — a force layout would
 * spend battery arriving at the same picture on every launch, and a map whose
 * landmarks move between visits is one you can never learn.
 *
 * Cluster size grows with the square root of its population, which is why
 * electronic is the biggest without being the whole picture: it holds half the
 * dataset but takes a third of the canvas.
 *
 * Tapping a genre does two things at once: it opens the panel for it and flies
 * the camera over to centre it, and it folds or unfolds whatever grows below it
 * — the subtree scaling out of its parent, or shrinking back into it. So you can
 * fold electronic away and actually see folk, and you can walk down into a
 * family one tap at a time. The panel names the subgenres rather than counting
 * them, and each of those is a tap to the next one.
 *
 * The panel expands. Collapsed it says what the curated dataset knows — family,
 * tempo, era, subgenres — which is a description of a genre's *shape* and never
 * of where it came from. Expanded it carries the genre's researched history:
 * its origins as the source states them, the genres either side of it in time,
 * and the article's own account of what happened, with the article and revision
 * it was taken from named and linked. That text is researched at build time and
 * verified to be about the genre it is filed under (`tools/fetch_genre_history.py`);
 * a genre with nothing verifiable written about it says so rather than being
 * given a plausible paragraph, because a map that invents history is worse than
 * one that admits a gap.
 *
 * The panel's four actions: *Play top* queues the genre's chart in rank order,
 * so it opens on the record that genre is actually known for. It used to search
 * the catalogue for the genre's name and shuffle the results, which ranked by
 * how well a title or album matched the words — the one query machine-generated
 * filler reliably wins. *Radio* opens a few of those tracks and then hands over
 * to the station planner, which keeps going. *Top 100* leaves the catalogue
 * behind and asks the outside world what this genre actually plays, over a
 * window. *Explore in Discover* hands the genre to the feed, which rebuilds
 * around it and its graph neighbours.
 *
 * The panel is drawn from the mini player's own glass settings — the Studio's
 * "Player Glass" tab — because it floats directly above the bar and two sheets
 * of glass tuned differently an inch apart looked like a bug.
