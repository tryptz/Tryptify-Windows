 * not contain the same id twice — a repeat would fight over one slot in the
 * unified-track registry, the second overwriting the first, and both entries
 * would then play the same stream while the queue claimed to hold two. And the
 * station the listener tapped has to be the one that comes out of the speaker,
 * which is not the same as "the row at [tappedIndex]" once rows have been
 * dropped from in front of it.
 *
 * The station directory is third-party and does not promise unique uuids —
 * `WorldRadioScreen` leaves its list unkeyed for exactly that reason — so this
 * is a real case rather than a defensive one.
 *
 * Duplicates keep their **first** appearance. Two rows with one id are one
 * station listed twice, so the earlier row is as good as the later one, and
 * keeping the first means the queue reads in the order the panel does.
