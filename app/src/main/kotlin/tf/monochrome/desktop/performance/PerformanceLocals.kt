 * MonochromeApp.profile)`.
 *
 * Dynamic rather than `static`. It used to be static, on the grounds that the
 * detected profile is resolved once at process start and never mutates — true
 * of the hardware tier, but the provided value is no longer the raw tier. The
 * root folds the user's "Remove liquid glass" switch into `allowHazeBlur`
 * ([LowPerformanceSettings]), so the profile now changes while the app runs and
 * every reader has to invalidate when it does.
