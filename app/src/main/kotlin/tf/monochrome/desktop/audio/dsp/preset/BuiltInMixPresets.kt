/**
 * Hard-coded showcase presets for the DSP Mixer.
 *
 * These ship with the app so a fresh install demonstrates the engine's reverb,
 * delay, modulation and dynamics processors. They use negative ids so they
 * never collide with Room's positive autoincrement, and `isCustom = false` so
 * the UI treats them as read-only (load, export — but not delete).
 *
 * ## Laid out the way a mastering engineer patches a desk
 *
 * Every stereo preset is built on the same console, wired with the mixer's
 * routes instead of one long chain on one bus:
 *
 *  - **Bus 1 — Source.** Takes the track. Corrective work only (a subsonic
 *    high-pass), and it does not go to the master itself: it feeds Tone and
 *    the effect sends, so everything downstream hears the cleaned signal.
 *  - **Bus 2 — Tone.** The dry path: broad tonal EQ, then stereo width —
 *    corrective before dynamics, tonal after, width late, in the usual order.
 *  - **Buses 3 and 4 — Returns.** Effects on aux returns, 100 % wet, fed by
 *    sends: reverbs high-passed at 200–300 Hz so no low end builds up in the
 *    tail, with pre-delay to keep the source articulate. A return can feed
 *    another (a delay into a reverb).
 *  - **Master — fader at 0 dB.** Glue compression only where the preset is
 *    about dynamics, and always last a limiter with its ceiling at −1 dB, the
 *    usual true-peak margin, to catch what EQ boosts and wet returns add.
 *    Level is made inside the chain, never by riding the master fader.
 *
 * The engine aligns every route for delay, so the dry and wet paths meet in
 * time however they are wired.
 *
 * Wide sources: with "spread channels" on, a 5.1 or Atmos song lands its
 * channel groups on buses 1–9 (centre on 2, LFE on 3, …), the same strips
 * these presets use as Tone and Returns. They are made for stereo; for a
 * wide song, spread off runs it all through bus 1 as designed.
 *
 * ## Atmos Upmix
 *
 * The one preset that is not stereo: it turns on the upmix, which spreads a
 * stereo song to 9.1.6 ahead of the mixer (StereoUpmixer), so its nine
 * channel groups arrive on buses 1–9 and each strip shapes one of them.
