/**
 * How the exclusive USB path moves its gain to a new volume.
 *
 * Applying a new gain from one buffer to the next is a step in the waveform,
 * heard as a click on every slider move and key press ("zipper" noise). So
 * the sink moves the gain a frame at a time instead, at these rates:
 *  - up, over [RISE_SECONDS] whatever the size of the change: this is also
 *    the fade-in when the DAC starts from silence, so a stream arrives at its
 *    level over half a second rather than all at once;
 *  - down, over [FALL_SECONDS] of full scale: quick enough to feel
 *    immediate, which turning something down should be.
 *
 * Linear in gain and constant within a buffer, so the gain after any number
 * of frames is exact ([after]): a write the DAC only partly takes resumes from
 * the gain of the last frame it took, with no jump.
 *
 * Arithmetic only — called per frame on the audio thread, it allocates nothing.
