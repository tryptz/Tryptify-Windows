/**
 * Where each channel of an interleaved stream sits, for the processors that
 * have to treat channels differently: the EQs (which ear's curve), and the
 * mixer (which channels travel as a stereo pair).
 *
 * The orders are the ones Android plays, which is what Media3 builds the
 * AudioTrack from (`Util.getAudioTrackChannelConfig`): the channel-mask bits
 * in ascending order. So 5.1 is FL FR FC LFE BL BR and 7.1.4 is
 * FL FR FC LFE BL BR SL SR TFL TFR TBL TBR — every left channel immediately
 * followed by its right partner. Sixteen channels are 9.1.6 in FFmpeg's order
 * (the decoder's): FL FR FC LFE BL BR FLC FRC SL SR TFL TFR TBL TBR TSL TSR,
 * the same reading DownmixProcessor folds it by. Counts with no layout (9, 11,
 * 13–15) are read as consecutive left/right pairs, with a trailing odd
 * channel in the centre; that is the only reading that keeps pairs together
 * for any source that pairs its channels at all.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, so the mapping is unit tested rather than trusted.
