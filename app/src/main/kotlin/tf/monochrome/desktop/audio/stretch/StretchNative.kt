 * JNI bridge to the vendored signalsmith-stretch engine (see
 * `third_party/signalsmith-stretch`), which transposes without moving the
 * tempo — the thing neither resampling nor Sonic's speech-tuned WSOLA can do
 * for music.
 *
 * [isAvailable] is false when the library is missing, which is the normal case
 * in JVM unit tests and the safe case on a device where the ABI did not ship.
 * Callers must treat that as "no pitch shift" and pass audio through, never as
 * an error: an unavailable effect has to stay silent, not break playback.
