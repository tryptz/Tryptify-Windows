/**
 * The EBU R128 loudness meter's native half (cpp/dsp/meter/): fed by
 * [SpectrumAnalyzerTap] from the audio thread, read by the Audio Pipeline panel
 * and the mixer's master strip.
 *
 * Measured where the tap sits — after the mixer, the fold-down and both EQs,
 * before the speed stages — so it is the loudness of what Tryptify hands to the
 * output, at the source's own speed.
 *
 * Runs only while something is reading it, like the analyzer itself: a
 * [acquire] from zero readers starts the measurement afresh, so Integrated and
 * Range always mean "since this meter came on screen, or since the track
 * changed, whichever is later". Nothing is measured while nobody is looking.
