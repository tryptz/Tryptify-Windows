/**
 * Transposition that leaves the tempo alone, via signalsmith-stretch.
 *
 * The other two ways this app can move pitch both couple it to something else:
 * resampling drags the tempo with it, and Sonic's WSOLA only stretches time.
 * This is the one that decouples them, at the cost of being a phase vocoder —
 * so its accuracy is set by how finely it resolves a partial rather than by
 * arithmetic. The native side picks a 0.35 s analysis block for that reason:
 * measured worst-case error 0.179 Hz over semitones -12..+12 and fundamentals
 * 82 Hz..3.5 kHz, against 1.348 Hz at the library's default 0.12 s block.
 *
 * That block buys its precision with latency — about 350 ms round trip, which
 * [latencyFrames] reports so the AutoEQ pre-warp can glide over the same window
 * instead of re-warping before the pitch change is audible.
 *
 * Frame count in equals frame count out; only the spectrum moves.
