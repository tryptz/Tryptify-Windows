/**
 * Tiny pipeline that drives Media3 [AudioProcessor]s manually so the
 * libusb output path can run the same DSP / EQ / tap chain that
 * DefaultAudioSink owns internally. Without this, switching to
 * exclusive USB DAC silently drops AutoEQ + parametric EQ + DSP
 * effects + spectrum FFT + ProjectM audio feed — because all of
 * those live inside DefaultAudioSink's processor chain we bypass.
 *
 * Lifecycle mirrors AudioProcessor:
 *   configure(inputFormat) → outputFormat
 *   process(input) → ByteBuffer (output)  // call repeatedly
 *   flush() / reset()
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Each processor's getOutput() returns a buffer owned by the
 *    processor; we hand that buffer straight to the next stage.
 *  - queueInput consumes as much as the processor can take in one
 *    call; partial consumption is fine — the renderer retries on
 *    the next handleBuffer tick with the unconsumed remainder.
 *  - Inactive processors (configure returned NOT_SET or threw
 *    UnhandledAudioFormatException) are skipped — the buffer flows
 *    through unchanged.
