/**
 * Stereo → 9.1.6, written so the fold back to stereo gives the song back.
 *
 * Output is 16 channels in the order the rest of the pipeline reads a 9.1.6
 * bed ([ChannelLayout]): FL FR FC LFE BL BR FLC FRC SL SR TFL TFR TBL TBR TSL
 * TSR. The mixer spreads that onto nine buses, and [DownmixProcessor] folds
 * it to stereo (or the spatial map places it) unless the listener passes it
 * through. Most people hear the fold, so this is built around it: every
 * piece taken out of the stereo is put back by the fold's own matrix
 * (all lefts to the left at 1, FC at [DownmixProcessor.CENTER_COEF], LFE at
 * [DownmixProcessor.LFE_COEF] into both). The split, in the order an upmix
 * engineer works:
 *
 *  - **Bass** below [CROSSOVER_HZ] (the LFE convention). A share of the
 *    low mid goes to the LFE at 1 / LFE_COEF and both front speakers give
 *    up that much, so the fold restores it exactly. The share is steered
 *    like the centre: all of it for bass that is the same on both sides,
 *    none for a bass line panned to one side — moving that would leave an
 *    inverted copy in the opposite speaker to cancel it in the fold, which
 *    is right on paper and wrong in a room. The low/high split is
 *    complementary (high = input − low), so the bands sum to the input.
 *  - **Centre**: a share of the mid, divided by CENTER_COEF so the fold puts
 *    back what the front pair gave up. The share follows the signal: high
 *    when left and right are correlated and balanced (a lead vocal), zero
 *    for a hard-panned part, which a static matrix would smear into the
 *    middle. Capped at [CENTRE_MAX] so a vocal keeps a little width.
 *  - **Ambience**: a share of the side signal, high when the two channels are
 *    decorrelated and balanced (reverb, room), zero for a hard pan, so
 *    panned instruments stay in front. It is spread over the six surround
 *    and height pairs with weights whose squares sum to one, each through
 *    its own delay and allpass so the copies are decorrelated, and the fold
 *    keeps the ambience's energy rather than stacking six copies of it.
 *    The delays (5–20 ms) are the precedence effect: the image stays
 *    anchored at the front and the room opens up behind and above it.
 *
 * Exactness: the bass and the centre fold back to the input sample for
 * sample. The ambience folds back at the same average power but not the
 * same waveform — the decorrelation is the point — so a sustained tone that
 * is also decorrelated can pick up a little comb colour in the fold. That
 * is the trade every upmixer makes; it is kept to the content that is
 * already diffuse, where it is least audible.
 *
 * [enabled] crossfades over [FADE_MS] between the upmix and a plain
 * FL/FR copy of the input, which folds back to the input exactly — so the
 * switch can turn off mid-track without a format change.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin with no Android types, so it is unit tested on the JVM.
