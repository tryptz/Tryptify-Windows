/**
 * Where a crossfade's outgoing tail meets the exclusive USB stream.
 *
 * The DAC belongs to one stream — the main player's, written by
 * [LibusbAudioSink] — so a blend cannot open a second one the way it does on
 * Android's mixer. Instead the tail player's sink ([MixFeedAudioSink]) writes
 * its finished audio here, already at the DAC's rate and as float, and the
 * main sink adds it into its own samples just before they are packed for the
 * DAC: one stream, two songs.
 *
 * The main sink can be short-written by the DAC's ring, so it [peek]s tail
 * frames when it mixes and [consume]s only as many as the driver accepted —
 * consuming on peek would drop the rest, and a partial write would skip part
 * of the outgoing song.
 *
 * Threads: [offer] on the tail player's playback thread, [peek] / [consume]
 * on the main player's. One lock; every call is a short copy.
