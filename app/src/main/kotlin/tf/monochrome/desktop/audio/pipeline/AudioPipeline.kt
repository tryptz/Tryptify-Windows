 * Pure Kotlin on purpose — no Android, no Media3, no Compose. Everything in
 * this file is a plain value or a function of plain values, so the awkward
 * part (deciding what is true, and what to say when nothing is) is unit
 * testable, and the panel is left with nothing to do but draw it.
 *
 * ## The rule this file exists to enforce
 *
 * **A field with no source shows an em dash. It never shows a plausible
 * number.** This is a diagnostics panel: people screenshot it and open bug
 * reports from it, and they will believe whatever it says. Several of the
 * facts a pipeline panel conventionally shows genuinely do not exist in this
 * app — there is no resampler quality setting, no anti-alias cutoff on the
 * output path, no stereo expander unless one is inserted by hand — and
 * inventing convincing values for them would make every one of those bug
 * reports wrong in a way nobody could see.
