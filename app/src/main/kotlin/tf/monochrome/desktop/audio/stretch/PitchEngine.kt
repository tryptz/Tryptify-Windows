/**

 * Two engines rather than one, because they fail in opposite directions and no
 * single setting covers both. The vocoder resolves a partial to a fraction of a
 * hertz and smears attacks across its analysis block; WSOLA splices in the time
 * domain at waveform-similar points, so an attack survives, and sustained
 * polyphony picks up the phasiness the vocoder avoids. Which one is "better"
 * depends entirely on the record, so it is the listener's choice.

/**
 * How much work either engine may spend per second of audio.
 *
 * It means something different to each, and both are real. For WSOLA it is the
 * grain and its search radius, and the radius decides the lowest frequency that
 * survives a splice -- below that floor a note still plays but its pitch
 * wanders, because the splices land mid-cycle: 110 Hz through FAST measures
 * about 8% flat. For the vocoder it is the analysis block, which decides how
 * finely a partial can be resolved and how large an FFT runs on every hop.
 *
 * That second meaning is new, and it is why this exists at all past WSOLA. The
 * vocoder's block was picked for accuracy alone, at nearly three times
 * upstream's own default, and the measurement that chose it never asked what it
 * cost -- which on a phone is a dropout.
