/**
 * Maps playout time to media time across speed changes.
 *
 * On the paths where the app changes speed itself — the hi-res float path and
 * exclusive USB — the output sink only ever sees the finished audio, so its
 * clock runs in *playout* time: one second of output is one second, whatever
 * speed produced it. The player needs *media* time. At a constant speed the
 * two differ by a factor; once speed changes mid-track the factor is only
 * right from the moment of the change onwards, so a single ratio applied to
 * the whole track (what the USB path used to do) jumps the position on every
 * change.
 *
 * This keeps one checkpoint per change: from playout time `outUs` onwards,
 * media advances `factor` µs per µs. Checkpoints are added at the *write*
 * position, which runs ahead of what is audible by the output's buffer, so
 * a lookup between the two still resolves against the older checkpoint — the
 * same arrangement DefaultAudioSink uses for its own speed changes.
 *
 * Before the first checkpoint, playout and media time are the same.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, and not thread-safe: the sink calls it from the playback thread only.
