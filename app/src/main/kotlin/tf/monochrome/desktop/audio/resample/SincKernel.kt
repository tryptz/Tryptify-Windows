/**
 * Windowed-sinc polyphase kernels for arbitrary-ratio resampling.
 *
 * The alternative, and what Media3's Sonic does in `interpolate()`, is to take
 * the two samples either side of the read position and blend them linearly.
 * That is a first-order interpolator: its response is `sinc^2`, which is
 * already -1.8 dB at 12 kHz and -4.8 dB at 19.2 kHz on a 48 kHz stream, and its
 * stopband falls off so slowly that the images it fails to suppress fold back
 * as inharmonic aliasing. On a pitch shift, that lands right where a headphone
 * correction is usually adding treble.
 *
 * A windowed sinc fixes both halves: a Kaiser window buys a designed stopband
 * (~80 dB here) instead of an accidental one, and the cutoff tracks the
 * resampling ratio so that speeding up band-limits the input *before*
 * decimating it rather than aliasing it back into the audible range.
 *
 * Design is not audio-thread work — it evaluates a sinc and a Bessel function
 * per tap per phase. Build the table when the ratio changes and let the audio
 * thread do nothing but multiply-accumulate.
