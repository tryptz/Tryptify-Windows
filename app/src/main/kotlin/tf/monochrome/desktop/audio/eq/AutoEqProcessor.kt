/**
 * Standalone 10-band parametric EQ AudioProcessor for AutoEQ headphone correction.
 * Completely independent of the mixer/DSP engine — sits in ExoPlayer's pipeline
 * as its own processor, always active when EQ is enabled.
 *
 * Uses decramped biquads (peaking, low shelf, high shelf): Vicanek matched-Z
 * peaking and tournament-matched shelves, so the response lands on the analog
 * prototypes the correction curves are designed against — see EqDspKernels.
 *
 * ## Pitch pre-warp
 *
 * Media3 puts [androidx.media3.common.audio.SonicAudioProcessor] — the thing
 * that serves `PlaybackParameters`' speed and pitch — at the *end* of
 * `DefaultAudioSink`'s chain: `DefaultAudioProcessorChain` copies the app's
 * processors into slots `0..n-1` and appends silence-skipping and Sonic after
 * them. This processor therefore runs *upstream* of the pitch shift.
 *
 * That ordering silently breaks the correction whenever pitch rides the speed
 * control (preserve-pitch off, e.g. the Nightcore preset). A pitch shift is a
 * multiplicative map on frequency, so Sonic scales *everything* this EQ
 * produced by the same ratio — including the correction curve itself. A notch
 * cut for a 3 kHz driver resonance leaves the sink at 3 kHz x ratio: it misses
 * the resonance it was aimed at, *and* digs a hole in clean spectrum next to
 * it. Two errors from one. The damage tracks the slope of the correction, so
 * it is worst exactly where AutoEQ works hardest — high-Q treble resonance
 * notches, where a band's whole half-gain bandwidth can be ~0.36 octaves
 * against a 1.25x shift's 0.32.
 *
 * The compensation is exact: tune each band to `freq / ratio` so Sonic's
 * `x ratio` lands it back on `freq`. Q needs no adjustment — a pitch shift is
 * a rigid translation on a log-frequency axis, which preserves bandwidth in
 * octaves — and the preamp is untouched, since a translation does not change
 * peak gain. At ratio 1.0 (any speed with preserve-pitch on, or 1.0x either
 * way) the warp is the identity and this costs nothing.
 *
 * ## Why the warp glides
 *
 * Retuning the whole chain the instant the ratio changes would step every
 * band's centre frequency at once, which is audible as a lurch. Instead the
 * applied warp chases the target with a one-pole glide in the log-frequency
 * domain (constant octaves per second, the musically even sweep), so the
 * correction slides into its new alignment over [GLIDE_TAU_MS]-ish rather than
 * jumping. Chasing a live target means dragging the speed slider sweeps the
 * correction along with it, and letting go settles it exactly on the target —
 * no touch/release plumbing needed, and the glide stops ticking once settled.
 *
 * Coefficient *design* stays off the audio thread. It has to: the matched
 * shelf design allocates and runs a scored tournament over candidate
 * constructions, whose own docs note the cost is only irrelevant because
 * "shelves change rarely". Under a glide they change constantly, so the glide
 * loop designs coefficients at control rate and publishes them as an immutable
 * snapshot; the audio thread does five float stores per band to install them,
 * with the filter memory left running so the sweep is continuous.
