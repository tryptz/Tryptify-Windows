/**
 * The mix's Atmos upmix switch, carried in its state JSON as a top-level
 * `"upmix":"9.1.6"` after the bus list.
 *
 * In the state JSON rather than a preference of its own, so it travels with
 * everything that moves a mix — the saved mix, presets, export and import,
 * cloud sync — without any of them knowing about it. It is attached and
 * stripped on the Kotlin side ([tf.monochrome.desktop.audio.dsp.DspEngineManager]),
 * so the native engine never sees it, and a build from before it simply
 * ignores the key: the engine's parser walks from one bus's `{"gain":` to the
 * next and never reaches a top-level key after them.
