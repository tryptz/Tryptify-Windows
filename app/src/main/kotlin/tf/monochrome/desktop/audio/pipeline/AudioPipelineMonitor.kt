/**
 * The two facts only the playback service can see.
 *
 * `PlayerViewModel` reaches the player through a `MediaController`, and a
 * MediaController carries neither `Format` nor any decoder identity — so the
 * stream's real bitrate, its PCM depth, and the name of the codec doing the
 * work are invisible to every screen in the app. The service can see all
 * three, through an `AnalyticsListener`.
 *
 * The service runs in this process (no `android:process` in the manifest), so
 * a singleton is the whole bridge, in the same shape as `PlaybackStateRepository`
 * and `SpectrumAnalyzerTap` already use for the same boundary.
 *
 * Written from the player's application thread, read from composition.
