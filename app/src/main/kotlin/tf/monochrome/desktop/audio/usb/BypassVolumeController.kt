/**
 * The volume of the exclusive USB path, which [LibusbAudioSink] applies to
 * PCM before handing it to libusb.
 *
 * It exists because that path skips AudioFlinger entirely: Android's own
 * volume, the keys and the system slider only steer STREAM_MUSIC, which never
 * reaches a DAC driven over libusb. Without this the DAC played at whatever
 * level it was left at, full scale on most, which is the "dangerous startup
 * sound levels" a review of the app warned about.
 *
 * Two inputs, multiplied on the audio thread by [getVolume]:
 *  - the DAC level, in decibels ([levelDb]): what the glass volume slider and
 *    the volume keys set. Decibels because hearing is logarithmic: a linear
 *    0..1 put most of its travel within a few dB of full and made the bottom
 *    steps the loud ones. Every session starts at [SAFE_START_DB] (see
 *    [startSession]) and is never saved, so a DAC never opens at full scale.
 *  - the player's own gain ([setVolume]): crossfade ramps and the like, as
 *    PlaybackService has always pushed it.
 *
 * At 0 dB with the player at unity the sink passes PCM through untouched, so
 * bit-perfect output stays bit-perfect.
 *
 * Writes are single stores to volatile fields and reads single loads: the
 * audio thread never locks or allocates to read the volume.
