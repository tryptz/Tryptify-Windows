/**
 * A complete, independent copy of the audio processing chain — its own native
 * DSP engine, its own AutoEQ and Parametric EQ, its own Oxford post-chain.
 *
 * The app's normal chain is a set of singletons wired into the one ExoPlayer.
 * That is right for a single stream and wrong for a crossfade, where two tracks
 * are sounding at once: a processor holds per-stream filter state, and the
 * native engine holds one sample rate, so feeding two streams through a single
 * chain would corrupt both. Playing the outgoing tail *without* processing
 * isn't acceptable either — it would audibly drop the user's EQ and DSP for the
 * length of every blend.
 *
 * So the blend gets its own chain. The native engine is handle-based
 * (`enginePtr` on every call), so a second instance is a first-class thing
 * rather than a hack, and [seedFrom] copies the live settings across so the
 * copy sounds identical to what was already playing.
 *
 * A copy is short-lived: created when a blend starts, [release]d when it ends,
 * which destroys its native engine. Nothing else in the app should hold one.
