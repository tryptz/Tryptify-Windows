/**
 * How far from home the listener wants Discover to go, in 0..1.
 *
 * 0 is "more of what I already play" — new releases from artists in the
 * library, favourites, top artists. 1 is "show me things I don't know" —
 * neighbouring artists and whole genres the library barely touches. The
 * default sits just off centre, slightly toward the familiar, because a feed
 * that opens on strangers has nothing to anchor trust to.
 *
 * This is deliberately one number and not fourteen. The app exposes fourteen
 * recommendation weights in Settings › Radio, and they are the right controls
 * for someone who wants them; the feed needs a single axis it can be reasoned
 * about along, and "familiar ↔ adventurous" is the one people actually think
 * in.
 *
 * It was briefly a slider on the page, and the slider is gone — the shelf mix
 * it moved is a row or two either way, which is hard to see against a feed
 * that reshuffles anyway, and it cost a permanent strip above the first shelf.
 * The axis stays because the feed is built along it; it now sits at [DEFAULT]
 * for everyone.
