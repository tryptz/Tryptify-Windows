/**
 * How a Discover category is ordered.
 *
 * Applied to shelves that have already been fetched rather than pushed into the
 * search: Qobuz ranks a genre query one way and one way only, so asking it for
 * "the newest drum & bass" is not a request it can answer. Sorting what came
 * back is instant, works identically for every category — a mood, a genre, the
 * personalized feed — and never costs a second round trip when the listener
 * changes their mind.
 *
 * The three are genuinely different orderings, not three names for the same
 * list. [POPULAR] is the catalogue's own ranking, which is what a search
 * returns; [NEWEST] is by release year; [FOR_YOU] floats what the listener
 * already plays to the front of every shelf.
