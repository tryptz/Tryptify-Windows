 * not overlap. ListenBrainz can say what the world played in a bounded window
 * but not what genre any of it was; Last.fm can rank any genre you can name but
 * has no notion of when. So a windowed chart is the global window narrowed by
 * the genre's artists, and when that intersection is too thin to be a chart —
 * which is the normal case for a small scene, where a week of global listening
 * may contain almost none of it — this falls back to the all-time ranking and
 * *says that it did*. A chart labelled "7 days" that is quietly showing all-time
 * data is worse than no chart, because a listener has no way to tell.

/**
 * Narrow a global windowed chart down to one genre.
 *
 * Matching is on artist rather than recording because that is the join the two
 * services can actually agree on: MusicBrainz will tell you which artists carry
 * a tag, and ListenBrainz reports an artist name on every row. Recording-level
 * genre tags exist but are far sparser, so joining on them would throw away most
 * of the window.
 *
 * Ranks are rebuilt afterwards. The surviving rows carry their global positions
 * — 4, 51, 900 — and presenting those as a genre chart would suggest 895 hard
 * techno tracks nobody bothered to show.
 */
/**
 * Float the artists MusicBrainz confirms for this genre above the ones it doesn't.
 *
 * Last.fm tags are crowd-applied, and a very popular artist accumulates loose
 * ones: `hard techno` comes back led by FKA twigs and Charli xcx, with the first
 * actual hard techno producer at number three. Nobody sat down and decided that
 * — it is what happens when a million casual taggers meet an artist who is on
 * everyone's radar. MusicBrainz tags are curated by people editing a database,
 * so they disagree in exactly the useful direction.
 *
 * Demotion rather than deletion, because MusicBrainz coverage is partial: a
 * genuinely obscure producer may simply not be in the artist set, and dropping
 * unconfirmed rows would quietly delete the deep cuts a genre chart exists to
 * surface. Sorting them below the confirmed ones fixes the head of the chart —
 * which is what anybody actually reads, and what playback opens on — while
 * costing nothing at the tail.
 *
 * Both guards matter. With no artist set at all (a genre MusicBrainz has never
 * heard of) and with nothing confirmed (a set that missed entirely), the chart
 * is returned untouched rather than shuffled on no evidence.
