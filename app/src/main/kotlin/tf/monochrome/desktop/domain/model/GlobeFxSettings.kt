/**
 * How the world globe's coastlines and borders are lit.
 *
 * The outlines are drawn in the map's neutral ink by default, which is honest
 * but inert — the dots carry the app's accent colour and the land they sit on
 * carries none of it. [illumination] moves the outlines toward that same accent
 * so the globe reads as one object in the app's palette rather than a grey map
 * with coloured pins on it, and [glowBrightness] lays a soft halo under the
 * stroke so the lit coast looks lit rather than merely recoloured.
 *
 * Everything here is static per camera. Nothing in this file reacts to audio,
 * and nothing in it should: the outlines are re-projected from ~5,100 points on
 * every draw, so anything that changes them per frame turns the globe into a
 * full redraw at 60 Hz, which is what it costs to move a coastline.
 *
 * Persisted as one JSON blob. Decoding ignores unknown keys, so a settings row
 * written by an older build simply falls back to these defaults.
