/**
 * What a genre's history actually says, researched rather than generated.
 *
 * Every field here is text taken from a specific revision of a specific English
 * Wikipedia article that was *verified* to be about this genre — either it
 * carries `{{Infobox music genre}}` or Wikidata records it as an instance of
 * "music genre" — and nothing is written for a genre where that check failed.
 * See `tools/fetch_genre_history.py`, which does the verifying and bakes the
 * asset; the whole point of that file is that a genre with no documented
 * history gets no paragraph rather than a plausible one.
 *
 * [revision] and [url] are not decoration. The text is CC BY-SA 4.0 and has to
 * carry its attribution, and a claim about where a genre came from is worth
 * exactly as much as the source you can go and check it against — so the panel
 * shows the article it came from and links to it.
