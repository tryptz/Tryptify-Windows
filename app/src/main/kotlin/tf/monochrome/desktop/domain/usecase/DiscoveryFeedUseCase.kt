 * reason ("Because you play X"), because an unexplained recommendation is one
 * the listener has no way to trust or correct. And personalized and curated
 * shelves are no longer mutually exclusive — the old feed showed genre rows
 * *only* to users with no taste data at all, so an established listener never
 * saw anything outside their own orbit and a new one never saw anything else.
 *
 * Everything runs through the Qobuz instance so ids stay in one namespace.

 * How a genre shelf says it knows what it knows.

 * A row on this feed always states its evidence — that is most of the
 * difference between a recommendation and a dump — and a row built from two
 * sources has to name both rather than claim the stronger one for all of it.
 * The wording is in listeners' terms rather than the pipeline's: "ranked by
 * plays" is the tag chart, "its most-played artists" is the catalogue's own
 * ranking for the artists that chart names, and "by way of" is a genre the
 * world has scrobbled too little of to rank at all.
 *
 * Nothing here claims a genre *check*. The artists are confirmed where that
 * evidence was cheap or already bought and left in the chart's order
 * otherwise — but either way they are the genre's most-played artists, so the
 * line stays true without asserting a verification that may not have run.

 * Whether this record is only in the results because it says the genre's name.

 * The catalogue search is a title/album match, so asking it for a genre returns
 * two kinds of thing: records that *are* the genre, and records that merely
 * *mention* it — "Hardstyle Fish", "I'm so lucky! - Hardstyle", and the endless
 * compilations called "Techno 2024". The second kind wins the ranking, because
 * putting the genre in the title is exactly how you get found by someone
 * searching for the genre.
 *
 * The test is deliberately one-directional: the genre's name appearing in the
 * title or the album title is suspicious, the track's title appearing in the
 * genre's name is not (a track really called "Techno" by a techno artist is a
 * normal record). Callers pair this with artist evidence and let confirmed
 * artists through regardless, so a genre's own defining track is never dropped
 * for being named after it.
 *
 * Matching is on whole words, so "Trance" does not fire on "Entrance" and
 * punctuation differences don't matter.
