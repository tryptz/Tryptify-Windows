/**
 * Find the genre someone means from what they typed.
 *
 * 771 genres is well past the number you can put in a row and expect anyone to
 * scroll, and the ones a listener wants are rarely the ones a static row would
 * pick. Typing is the only interface that reaches all of them.
 *
 * The graph already knows how to resolve a name — `dnb`, `d&b`, `drum n bass`
 * and 2,184 MusicBrainz spellings all land on the right node — so an exact hit
 * is delegated to it rather than reimplemented. What this adds is the partial
 * case, which is most of typing: "har" while you are still reaching for
 * hardstyle, "liquid" for a genre whose real name is liquid drum & bass, or
 * "techo" because the phone's keyboard is small.
