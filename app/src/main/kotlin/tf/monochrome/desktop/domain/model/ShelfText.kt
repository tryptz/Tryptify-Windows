/**
 * What a discovery shelf's title or reason says, without choosing the words.
 *
 * The feed used to write its lines as English templates — "Because you play
 * $name", "Popular in ${genre.lowercase()}" — which cannot be translated after
 * the fact: the name is already inside the sentence, and lower-casing it is an
 * English rule (German capitalises the noun, Chinese and Japanese have no case
 * at all). So the feed says *which* phrase it means and with what, and the UI
 * puts that into words in the listener's language.
 *
 * [english] is the line exactly as the feed always worded it. It is what
 * [DiscoveryShelf.title] and [DiscoveryShelf.reason] still carry, so anything
 * that reads those — de-duplication, track tagging, the tests that pin the
 * composition rules — sees no change at all.
