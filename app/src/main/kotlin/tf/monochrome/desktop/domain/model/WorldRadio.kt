/**
 * A city on the globe, and how much radio comes out of it.
 *
 * A city is in this dataset only because live stations were found naming it at
 * build time (`tools/fetch_world_radio.py`). That is the whole claim a dot on the
 * globe makes: you can tune into something here. Cities nobody broadcasts from
 * are absent rather than drawn empty.
 *
 * [lat] and [lon] are stored as hundredths of a degree — see [WorldRadioData.scale]
 * — because at 0.01° the error is under a screen pixel at any zoom the globe
 * offers, and integers halve the asset.
 *
 * [stations] is the count measured at build time. It sizes the dot and nothing
 * else: what a listener actually gets is fetched live when they tap, because
 * stream URLs rot far faster than the app ships.
