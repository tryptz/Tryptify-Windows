 * through [publish]; a reader calls [awaitAvailable] and blocks only when it
 * catches up with the writer. That's what lets playback start on the first
 * bytes instead of waiting for the whole file.
 *
 * Both sides are plain blocking monitor calls rather than coroutines on
 * purpose: the reader is ExoPlayer's loader thread, which is designed to block
 * inside a DataSource exactly like a network read would.
