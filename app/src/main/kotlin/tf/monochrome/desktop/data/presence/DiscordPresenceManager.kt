 * switched on — and closed as soon as playback stops for good, rather than
 * being held for the life of the process. There is no reason for a music app to
 * keep a websocket alive while nothing is playing, and every reason not to.
 *
 * Updates are event-driven, not polled. Discord animates the progress bar from
 * the `start`/`end` timestamps in the activity, so a frame is only sent when
