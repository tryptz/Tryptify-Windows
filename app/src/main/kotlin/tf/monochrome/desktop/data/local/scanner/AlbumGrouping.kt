/**
 * Which album each local track belongs to.
 *
 * The key is album title + album artist (else the track's own artist) +
 * year, as [buildAlbumGroupingKey] makes it. Keyed on the bare tags, a track
 * missing one its album's other tracks have was split off into an album of
 * its own: a song downloaded as a single, next to the album it is from,
 * carries no album artist and no year, so "1" by The Beatles came out twice.
 * Now such a track is not split off for that alone:
 *  - without an album artist, it takes the one named by the same-titled
 *    album's tracks in its folder, if its own artist credits that album
 *    artist or one of those tracks' artists ("The Beatles, Billy Preston"
 *    credits The Beatles). A flat folder holds many artists, and ABBA's
 *    "Greatest Hits" track is not Queen's because the titles match;
 *  - without a year, it takes the year of the album with its title and
 *    artist (the most common one, if the album's tracks give several).
 * Different releases still stay apart: the same title in two years, under
 * two album artists, or by two artists in two folders without one. Tracks
 * with no album tag keep their key: they are not an album together.
 *
 * Kept free of Android and Room types so it can be unit tested.
