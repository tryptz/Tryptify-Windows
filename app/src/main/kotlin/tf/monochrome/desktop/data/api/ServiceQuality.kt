/**
 * What each service's quality settings offer, in that service's own terms.
 *
 * TIDAL, Qobuz and Deezer each stream and download in a setting of their own,
 * because one tier means different files on each: "High" is AAC 320 in an
 * .m4a on TIDAL and MP3 320 on Qobuz and Deezer, and Deezer has nothing above
 * CD quality. So every option names the codec and what arrives, and a service
 * only offers the tiers it can actually send. Apple has its own ladder
 * ([tf.monochrome.desktop.data.preferences.AppleQuality]) and is not here.
 *
 * Kept free of Android types so it can be unit tested; the descriptions are
 * string resource ids, translated like the rest of Settings. The labels are
 * codec names and stay as they are in every language.
