/**
 * One request per question, however many callers ask it at once.
 *
 * Every cache behind the discovery feed is check-then-fetch, which is correct
 * in sequence and wrong under concurrency: the feed builds six shelves at the
 * same moment, and "the answer is already in the memo" is only true for the
 * shelf that got there first. The other five look, find nothing — the first
 * one has not returned yet — and issue the same request. A genre and its
 * neighbours are largely the same people and largely the same records, so this
 * is the normal case rather than a race that occasionally happens.
 *
 * The duplicates cost more than their own latency. Catalogue lookups run behind
 * a fixed number of permits, so a second copy of a question already in flight
 * is not merely wasted, it is *taking the place of* a question nobody has asked
 * yet. Collapsing them is what makes the memos deliver the saving they claim.
 *
 * Cancellation belongs to whoever was cancelled. If the caller that happened to
 * be leading a flight goes away — a shelf whose budget expired, a feed replaced
 * by a chip tap — the callers waiting behind it do not inherit that: they see
 * the flight end without an answer and one of them starts it again. Any other
 * choice makes a shelf's timeout contagious.

/**
 * Map every item concurrently, at most [concurrency] of them in flight, in
 * order.
 *
 * The shape this replaces was `chunked(n).flatMap { it.map(::async).awaitAll() }`,
 * which is not a concurrency limit but a lockstep barrier: a batch of eight
 * runs at the pace of its slowest member, and seven idle slots wait out the
 * eighth before the next batch is even started. On a page where four shelves
 * share one pool of permits those idle slots are the page's throughput —
 * they are permits nobody is using while somebody else's shelf is blocked
 * waiting for one.
 *
 * Here a finished lookup releases its permit immediately and the next item
 * takes it, so the pipe stays full for as long as there is work. The result is
 * still in the input's order, which the callers depend on: a chart is a
 * ranking, and resolving it out of order would reorder it.
