/**
 * Where a download goes inside the user's download folder, and how to read
 * that back.
 *
 *     <folder>/<Album artist>/<Album>/01. Title.flac
 *     <folder>/<Album artist>/<Album>/cover.jpg
 *     <folder>/<Album artist>/<Album>/Disc 2/01. Title.flac
 *     <folder>/<Album artist>/<Album>/Disc 2/cover.jpg
 *     <folder>/<Artist>/Title.flac                         (no album known)
 *
 * Everything used to land flat in the folder as "Artist - Title.flac". Besides
 * the clutter, the folder had exactly one cover.jpg, claimed by whichever album
 * was downloaded first, and Android's media scanner then gave that cover to
 * every song in the folder.
 *
 * Disc 2 onwards gets a "Disc N" folder inside the album's, with a cover.jpg of
 * its own, because Android reads folder art only from the file's own folder.
 * Disc 1 stays in the album folder: a download does not know how many discs
 * its album has, so it cannot tell a single-disc album from the first disc of
 * several. The disc number in the file name instead ("2-01") was considered
 * and rejected: it sorts before track 20 of disc 1, and a numeric-aware file
 * manager sorts it between "02" and "03".
 *
 * A track with no album goes straight into its artist's folder and never gets
 * a cover.jpg there. A shared folder of singles would bring back the
 * first-cover-wins problem this replaces.
