/**
 * Fetch-and-cache in front of [ChartsClient].
 *
 * The caching here is what makes per-genre charts affordable at all. A sitewide
 * pull is a thousand rows and is *the same thousand rows for every genre* — the
 * genre filter runs locally afterwards — so one fetch per window serves all 355
 * genres on the map. Without that, walking the map would be a network round trip
 * per node.
 *
 * Genre→artist sets are cached far longer than the charts themselves: which
 * artists count as hard techno moves on the timescale of a scene, not a week.
 *
 * Two things make the cache actually deliver that. Everything but the sitewide
 * pull survives the process in [DiscoveryCache], because a week-long TTL that
 * dies when the app is swapped out is a TTL of one session — and the artist
 * sets in particular are a MusicBrainz page walk paced at a request a second,
 * which is not a price to pay twice. And every fetch is single-flighted, because
 * check-then-fetch is only a cache in sequence: six shelves starting at the same
 * moment all look, all find nothing, and all issue the same request.
