/**
 * The qualities `/api/deezer/download` serves, and the codec behind each one.
 *
 * The endpoint takes the same `quality` codes as Qobuz's `/api/download-music`
 * — it rejects anything but `5`, `6`, `7` and `27` — but Deezer's own catalogue
 * is narrower than Qobuz's: every track item reports
 * `maximum_bit_depth: 16`, `maximum_sampling_rate: 44.1` and `hires: false`.
 * So the top two codes are accepted and land on CD-quality FLAC at best; they
 * are only asked for when a track item claims hi-res, which keeps a request
 * from being spent on a tier that cannot exist.
 *
 * Kept free of Android types so it can be unit tested.
