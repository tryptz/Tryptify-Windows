/**
 * Downloads one track: resolves a stream URL, streams it to disk, tags it,
 * saves lyrics and artwork, and records it in the database.
 *
 * This was the body of a `CoroutineWorker`, one instance per track. It is a
 * plain injectable now so [DownloadQueueRunner] can run several at a time under
 * one job and one notification — see [DownloadQueue] for why one job per track
 * was the wrong shape.
 *
 * Desktop: files land in a real folder — the one chosen in Settings
 * ([PreferencesManager.downloadFolderUri], a filesystem path here rather than a
 * SAF tree URI) or [tf.monochrome.desktop.platform.AppPaths.downloadsDir] —
 * through plain `java.io.File` writes. The naming, the FLAC tagging, the
 * embedded cover, the `.lrc` sidecar and the folder `cover.jpg` are the
 * Android app's.
