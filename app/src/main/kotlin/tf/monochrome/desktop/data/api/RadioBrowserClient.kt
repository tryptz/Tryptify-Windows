/**
 * radio-browser.info — the open community directory of internet radio.
 *
 * Queried at play time rather than bundled, because a stream URL that worked when
 * the release was cut is not a URL that works today: the directory carries tens
 * of thousands of stations and a steady trickle of them go dark every week. What
 * the app ships is the *geography* (see `tools/build_world_radio.py`); what it
 * asks for here is what is actually on air right now.
 *
 * A city's stations are found the same three ways the build-time pass finds
 * them — the location lands in a different field depending on who filed the
 * entry — and the results are merged rather than ranked against each other:
 *
 *   state=   the usual home of a city name
 *   name=    city broadcasters that put it in their own name ("Radio Hamburg")
 *   tag=     everyone else
 *
 * Every call fails soft to an empty list. A city whose stations can't be reached
 * shows as "couldn't reach the directory", never as a city without radio — those
 * are different claims and the panel makes both.
