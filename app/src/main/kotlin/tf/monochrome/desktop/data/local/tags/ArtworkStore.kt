/**
 * Where extracted cover art lives, and what it is named. Two things about the
 * old store made the library rescan itself on almost every launch.
 *
 * It lived in `cacheDir`, which Android is entitled to empty whenever it wants
 * — and did. Every eviction left Room rows pointing at vanished JPEGs, which
 * the startup check answered with a *full library scan*. It lives in [filesDir]
 * now: app data, which the OS does not reclaim and "Clear cache" does not touch.
 *
 * And it was keyed by `MD5(filePath)`, so a 500-track album wrote the same
 * cover 500 times at whatever size it was embedded at — often 3000x3000. That
 * is what made it worth reclaiming. Art is keyed by the hash of its own encoded
 * bytes now, one file per cover, downscaled to [MAX_EDGE_PX] on the way in.
 *
 * Keys stay absolute paths: the column already holds paths to sidecar covers
 * and raw audio files, and every reader treats it as "a path to an image".
