/**
 * Assemble an animated WebP out of still ones.
 *
 * Android can encode a single WebP — `Bitmap.compress(WEBP_LOSSY, …)` — and
 * cannot encode an animated anything. There is no platform API for it: the
 * `ImageDecoder` / `AnimatedImageDrawable` pair decodes animations and never
 * writes them, and `MediaCodec` produces video containers that Discord will not
 * render in an asset slot. That is the whole obstacle to drawing a spectrum over
 * the album art, because the art changes every track and so the image has to be
 * made on the device.
 *
 * The way round it is that WebP's animation support lives in the *container*,
 * not in the codec. An animated file is a RIFF wrapper holding a VP8X header, an
 * ANIM chunk, and one ANMF chunk per frame — and each ANMF simply contains the
 * ordinary compressed bitstream that a still WebP already carries. So the frames
 * can be encoded one at a time by the platform, and this stitches them together
 * without ever touching a pixel.
 *
 * Written against the format rather than a library because there is no library:
 * every animated-WebP encoder for Android is a native build of libwebp, which is
 * several megabytes of .so per ABI to write a header this file writes in a
 * hundred lines.
 *
 * Verified by round-tripping the output through a decoder before this was
 * committed — the structure is unforgiving and a wrong length field produces a
 * file that is silently skipped rather than rejected.
