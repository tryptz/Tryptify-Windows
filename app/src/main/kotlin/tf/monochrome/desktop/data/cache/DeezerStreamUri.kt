/**
 * The `deezer://` URI contract between [StreamResolver][tf.monochrome.desktop.player.StreamResolver],
 * which mints these, and [DeezerPartialDataSource], which serves them.
 *
 * A Deezer track is handed to ExoPlayer as an identifier rather than as a
 * signed URL or a file path: the signed URL is short-lived, and the file may
 * not exist yet because it is still downloading. Resolving the identifier is
 * deferred to the moment the player actually opens it.
 *
 * Kept free of Android types so the round trip can be unit tested.
