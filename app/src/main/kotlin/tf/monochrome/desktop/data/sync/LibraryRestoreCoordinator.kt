/**
 * Puts the signed-in listener's library back on the device, by itself.
 *
 * The gap this closes: app settings have healed themselves on sign-in ever
 * since [SettingsSyncCoordinator] landed, while library data — playlists,
 * their tracks, favourites, mix presets — was pushed on every edit and pulled
 * only when somebody found the Sync button on the profile screen. One half of
 * an account repaired itself and the other half did not, so a device that lost
 * its playlist rows showed an empty Playlists tab indefinitely while a complete
 * set of playlists sat in the cloud where every earlier push had left them.
 * Nothing in the app deletes playlists in bulk, so the loss was never the
 * dangerous part; having no way back was.
 *
 * Runs on every sign-in and on every launch that starts already signed in.
 * That is safe to repeat: most of the pull is insert-if-not-exists, so it only
 * adds rows the device is missing, and the one exception is deliberate — EQ and
 * mixer presets take whichever copy was edited most recently, because a preset
 * that can never be overwritten is a preset whose edits never leave the device
 * that made them. Nor can it undo a local delete: it sends the device's
 * pending edits first and skips any row whose delete the cloud hasn't
 * confirmed yet (see [SyncOutbox]). It is bounded too: the automatic pass leaves the thousand
 * scrobbles of play history to the manual sync.
 *
 * Failures are logged and dropped. A restore is a repair, so a device that is
 * offline at launch is not broken, it is simply not repaired yet; it will try
 * again next launch.
