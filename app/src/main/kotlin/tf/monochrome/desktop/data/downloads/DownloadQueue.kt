 * platform for a handful of concurrent foreground services, multiplexed through
 * WorkManager's single [androidx.work.impl.foreground.SystemForegroundService]
 * with a notification id derived as `base + (trackId % 1000)` — which collides
 * outright for any two ids a thousand apart. Queueing an album, never mind fifty
 * tracks, put that machinery under exactly the load it handles worst.
 *
 * So the scheduler now owns one job. This class is the state it works from:
 * order is preserved, [CONCURRENCY] entries run at a time, and everything else
 * waits its turn. Enqueueing a thousand tracks is a thousand rows in a list, not
 * a thousand jobs.
 *
 * The list is persisted as JSON on every mutation, so a queue outlives the
 * process; per-entry progress deliberately is not, since a download that was
 * interrupted restarts from zero anyway.
