/**
 * Turning presets into cloud rows and back, kept out of the repository so the
 * decisions can be tested without a network or a database.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its arguments. Three decisions live in
 * this file, and each of them is invisible at the call site and expensive to get
 * wrong: which value identifies a preset across devices, which timestamp is
 * allowed to settle a conflict, and which fields must be written even when they
 * are empty.
 */

/**
 * Whether the cloud's copy of a preset should replace the device's.
 *
 * Newest edit wins, which is a deliberate departure from the
 * insert-if-not-exists the rest of the pull uses. Favourites and playlists are
 * set membership: add and remove are the whole vocabulary, a re-add is
 * idempotent, and "never overwrite local" loses nothing. A preset is a mutable
 * document under a stable key, sometimes an hour of tuning, and under
 * insert-if-not-exists the first version ever pushed is the only version any
 * other device ever sees.
 *
 * **Both arguments must be device clocks**, read from `created_at_ms` /
 * `updated_at_ms` and never from the `updated_at` column. Both preset tables
 * carry a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger that rewrites `updated_at` to `now()`, and an
 * upsert is an INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE, so from the second push of a
 * preset onwards that column records when a device last synced rather than when
 * anyone edited. Comparing it against `System.currentTimeMillis()` would also
 * put a server clock on one side and a phone's on the other, and ordinary clock
 * skew would then hand a stale cloud copy the right to overwrite a tuning the
 * user finished ten seconds ago.
 *
 * A local row that does not exist is not a conflict, so the caller inserts.
 * Ties go to local: equal timestamps are the same edit, and of the two options
 * writing is the one that can lose something.

/**
 * The upsert payload for an EQ preset.
 *
 * Built field by field rather than serialized from [SbEqPreset] because of
 * `bands_r`. The Supabase client drops Kotlin nulls from the payload rather
 * than writing them (this is why every other push here can leave `added_at`
 * null and still get the column's default), and a field absent from an
 * ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE is a field left at its previous value. So a preset
 * saved in 2-channel mode and then re-saved as mono would keep its old right
 * ear in the cloud, and the next device to pull it would hear a curve in one
 * ear that the user deleted. Writing an explicit JSON null is the difference.
 *
 * [EqPresetEntity.id] is already a stable string, minted once from a timestamp
 * when the preset is saved, so it is the cross-device identity as-is.
