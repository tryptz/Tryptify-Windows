/**
 * Loads the researched genre histories, on demand and never on the main thread.
 *
 * Unlike [GenreGraphRepository] this is *not* a `by lazy` off whichever thread
 * asks first. The asset is the better part of a megabyte of prose — an order of
 * magnitude more than the graph — and the graph's blocking lazy is only
 * defensible because search needs it during startup anyway. Nothing needs this
 * one until a listener expands the genre panel, so it is a suspending load on
 * the IO dispatcher, and a frame is never spent parsing it.
 *
 * Parsed at most once. The mutex is what makes that true: two panels expanded
 * in quick succession both find no cache, and without it both would decode the
 * whole asset.
 *
 * Fails soft, like every other asset here — a missing or malformed file means
 * the panel says the history isn't written yet, which is exactly what it says
 * for the genres the research legitimately found nothing for.
