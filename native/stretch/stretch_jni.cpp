// JNI bridge for signalsmith-stretch: independent pitch shifting, i.e. a
// transposition that does not drag the tempo along with it.
//
// The engine is a phase vocoder, so its pitch accuracy is bounded by how
// finely it can resolve a partial in its analysis block rather than by
// arithmetic. Measured on a 48 kHz stream, worst case over semitones -12..+12
// and fundamentals 82 Hz..3.5 kHz:
//
//     block    bins      latency   worst error   quality
//     0.12 s   8.33 Hz   120 ms    1.384 Hz      Fast
//     0.25 s   4.00 Hz   250 ms    0.419 Hz      Balanced (default)
//     0.35 s   2.86 Hz   350 ms    0.179 Hz      High
//
// tests/stretch_precision_test.cpp measures that column and fails if a block
// misses what its quality claims, because those figures are printed under the
// quality buttons -- see PitchQuality.vocoderErrorHz.
//
// Accuracy was for a long time the only axis this file considered, which is how
// 0.35 s came to be hard-coded for everyone: it is the smallest block holding
// the error inside half a hertz with real margin, and on that question alone it
// is the right answer. tests/stretch_cost_test.cpp asks the other question, and
// there 0.35 s is a quarter of the realtime budget on a desktop core -- which
// on a phone is all of it. Hence a control rather than a constant.
//
// Note the distinction: half-hertz *bin spacing* would need a two-second
// block. Half-hertz *accuracy* needs far less, because the vocoder interpolates
// within a bin — the block only has to be fine enough for that estimate to
// converge.
